title = "Misplaced mercy and lack of ruthlessness"

+++

One drawback we hindus had was misplaced generosity - a paucity of ruthlessness. The source is nothing but moral weakness and fragility. These people want approval and admiration of others. This is the disease that motivated moronic actions right from dharmarAja to PrithvirAja Chauhan to Nehru and Gandhi.

- Think what kind of disaster it would have been if kRShNa thought that way. That yudhiShThira gave duryodhana his choice of weapon and combatant when he emerged from the lake hiding spot, and kRShNa scolded him - "Again, even now you are gambling! A deceitful person should be destroyed with deceit without this kind of show." Alas! this consciousness found in bhIma and kRShNa turned out to be so rare!

## Not expelling Islam

Unlike spanish reconquista or the jApanese expulsion of christianity, various hindu empires did not mostly expel Islam from their conquered lands. This was a huge cumulative mistake.
