## On complexity and collapse
Tainter (MT's summary [here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/01/19/civilizational-collapse-complexity-innovation-and-neomania/)) noted:

- human societies are problem-solving organizations;
- sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance;
- increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita; and
- investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response often reaches a point of declining marginal returns.
