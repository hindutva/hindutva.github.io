## unmAda competition
- "Given that the current +++(rudhironmAda v2)+++ strain is still an unmāda it will compete vigorously with other unmāda-s for its host. Since, none of these unmāda-s kill the host the battle is not going to lead to attenuation in anyway... In any case we can say that already a covert war between two unmāda-s, like the crusade and the jihād, is under way among the maha-mleccha." - [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/06/08/pandemic-days-the-fizz-is-out-of-the-bottle/)
- "Finally, the second amendment of the mahāmleccha constitution and those who know how to make use of it will be the last line of defense for the pretonmāda. So these and the those infected by the new strain will clash. The former have the advantage of fecundity while the latter of propaganda and the economic backing from the converted vyāpārin-s. " - [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/06/08/pandemic-days-the-fizz-is-out-of-the-bottle/)
- "Marūnmāda’s foothold in mahāmleccha is still weak; hence, while they will take the side of the 4th strain the basic resolution of the war remains unclear." - [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/06/08/pandemic-days-the-fizz-is-out-of-the-bottle/)

### Observations
- They try to hide their White Judeo-christian beliefs and perspective, but it is there.

## Layers
- Soft pop culture exterior.
- Powerful, efficient institutions.
    - Government
    - Business
    - Church  

### Core philosophy
- Common goal: Preservation of economic power, lifestyle, while compromising to favor the dominant unmAda-s.
- patriotic "manifest destiny" core
    - Push the false claim: Western ethics = human rights.  

### Regarding India  
- Hindu thought has penetrated US pop culture (though not the core). So, India is worthy of being a "cool" satellite to the US core. \[See [American Veda](http://americanveda.com/), for details.\]
- USA wants subservient powers in the region to offset China. It is averse to India or Japan growing into assertive and powerful "equal" partners.
- Evangelical Abrahamist lobby is powerful. NGO's receiving funds from USAID and American public are active in suberting hindu culture and power. Example:
    - They [were active](http://plus.url.google.com/url?sa=z&n=1388342848381&url=http%3A%2F%2Findia.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F12%2F05%2Fu-s-evangelicals-indian-expats-teamed-up-to-push-through-modi-visa-ban%2F%3Femc%3Dedit_tnt_20131205%26tntemail0%3Dy%26_r%3D1%26&usg=UL19d9G051BEu0wXCAZdk2_6fzs.) in denying narendra moDi a visa.
    - This influence has been explored in detail in ["Breaking India: Western Interventions in Dravidian and Dalit Faultlines".](http://www.breakingindia.com/)
