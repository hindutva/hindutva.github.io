Apart from [general desiderata](../../desiderata/) already mentioned, we would like (in roughly decreasing priority)


- India should be a civilizational state, not a nation state (as expressed [here](http://www.indusresearch.org/Making-Sense-Indian-Civilizational-State.aspx)).
    - "Hinduism is to Bharat what water is to the human body: the foundation of our ancient heritage and the true source of our longevity." OGS16
    - "What we need are leaders who constantly and consistently prioritize the safety and security of Hindus without compromise." \[OGS16\]
- Understand and counteract the severe limitations of the dumbocratic system.
- National security and Territorial integrity of the hindu homeland is most important.
    - Not withstanding earlier fragmentation, there is greater strength in unity. The idea of what constituted the Aryavarta is quite ancient \[ See [here](../../external-affairs/id/)\].
- Protect hindu culture, urgently contain and treat Abe's diseases.
- Protect environment
- have effective law enforcement

## Economics.
- a robust economy with broad based prosperity.
- Cut the red tape - make it easier to start and run businesses.
- Develop excellent mass transit, reduce oil and lithium import. \[[SP17](https://www.facebook.com/shatruntapa/posts/1765092310192078)\]

## International politics.
- India should aggressively pursue its national interests.
    - It should aggressively counter the intolerant anti-hindu ideology of militant Islam everywhere in the world.  
- It should vigorously defend its borders from encroachments by its neighbors. Eg: China, Pakistan.

### Worldwide Heathen revival
- It should support pagans worldwide from the intolerant monotheisms and state suppression.
- \[[MT](http://indiafacts.co.in/historical-hindu-responses-abrahamism/)\] "it would be more apposite for Hindus to instead be leaders and catalysts of the heathen-world, encouraging the revival and restoration of local heathen traditions, serving more as a model, meta-template, and in some cases the “glue” rather than being transmitters of their own practice as is. Unlike the old thinkers discussed above, it is important to realize that the metaphysics of neo-vedānta or yoga are pretty useless by themselves in serving as a globalized version of the dharma. Rather the emphasis should be on rituals, which will become rites and festivals of the state at large as well as local provinces, both in India and elsewhere."
