## Potential weaknesses
- Racial admixture in our population makes it harder for us to be ruthless, since the inimical population and their backers look like us.
    - Motivating studies: 
        - Empathy constrained: Prejudice predicts reduced mental simulation of actions during observation of outgroups. \[[pdf](http://www.researchgate.net/publictopics.PublicPostFileLoader.html?id=512385f4e24a465848000000&key=9fcfd512385f426ae9)\]
    - Contrast with the homogenous Chinese and Japanese. Their homogeneity makes it easy for them to view converts as a fifth column of aliens and be ruthless.
- Suicidal philosophies "Idiot's vedanta" causes people to mistakenly believe that it is ok to tolerate Abrahamisms.
- Multiple front battle, dealing with: economically powerful Islamic states, western christian/ post-christian christian and Han imperialist powers.
- We are more divided (eg. by jAti-s competing for reservation) than they are.

## Ideas for strengthening the position of hindus in the Indian homeland
- Resettle Hindus from hindu-majority states like Himachal Pradesh in precarious states like Kashmir and Assam. 
- Stem or reverse the influx of muslim migrants from Bangladesh and Burma.
- Increase Hindu birthrate - through conscience, education and incentives.
- Suppress and cap the abrahamist birthrate (eg. by incentivizing or mandating sterilization).
- Maintain Hindu battle readiness and military participation. Require military service.
- Suppress Abrahamist ideology ruthlessly. (This is hard, but doable- as shown by China and mideval Japan.)
    - As a very first step, tackle foreign missionaries and chruch funded NGO-s.
    - Small scale and half hearted "ghar vApasi-s" and polemics cannot keep up with Muslim fertility.
    - Hinduize our critical institutions, especially the military.

## Have a plan B if India falls
How to strategically spread out to ensure Hindu survival.
- This is not to deny that we should do our best to improve Hindu position in India, but it is not a wise survival strategy to entirely concentrate there.
- **Desiderata** about the "destination".
    - The destination must have the economic ability to support new arrivals.
    - It is better if the natives of the "destination" are a mixture of races and ethnicities, so that racial hatred and ethnic cleansing is much less likely.
    - It is better if the "destination" has a strong pagan undercurrent.
- Strategic things Hindus should do **upon arriving at the ****"destination"**.
    - Don't just focus on making money, getting civil power and winning spelling bees. Do not neglect "military power and participation".
        - Remember the lessons from Uganda and Fiji.
- **Proposed destinations**
    - South and central america. (Racial admixture, extant hindu foothold in the north, large pagan undercurrent.)

## Lessons from other populations.
- Missionary mentality vs group cohesion tension
- See Jewish and Mormon examples elsewhere.
