Whatever works is far more important than what sounds cool.

## Long term
- Generally, our Abrahamistic (mostly muslim) brothers and sisters must be provided urgent help and treatment so as to rid them of their serious and dangerous memetic disease (more in the [treatment page](../../../rivals/abe-disease/islam/treatment/)). So what can be done to maximize our chances of victory? What is in our hands? 
    - We should clearly educate people (especially our families) about the nature of the dangerous memetic epidemic, the impossibility of long-term peaceful existence,  the urgent need to contain and treat the affected population. Our side should at least have as much clarity as the other side.
- Having studied examples like contemporary and historic China, Tajikistan, Tokugawa Japan, Erdogan, Putin and growing modern orthodox influence in Israel, we should position clear-headed folks in important branches of the government, military, and administration. When the time comes, they should be ready to act decisively to secure and consolidate power; before proceeding with the treatment program. In other words, filling such posts must be given far more prestige than working for fancy corporations.

## Medium term
Where Indian politics are concerned, as hindus, we favor ideas from the "center-right" in the short term. By "right", we mean the Hindu cultural right, not the Abrahamistic right or the "anti-socialist right".

### Take over BJP and co
- Necessary tactics for the future (from \[[KE](http://centreright.in/2014/08/the-modi-governments-hindu-agenda/#.U_Ndlj2x3Ua)\] article)
- "When American conservatives were dissatisfied with the wobbly unprincipled policies of the Republicans, they formed a conservative pressure group to influence Republican policy choices or get favoured Republican politicians elected. I am of course not recommending the contents of the Trotskyite or the Tea Party’s outlook, but their political tactic of creating a channel of focused pressure may be worthy of emulation."

### Corny hindutva as a slow watchdog
> "This leads one to the simple conclusion that even though Hindutva may appear corny to the elite it is an upwelling of the India’s true spirit- the Americans know it and are trying to stanch it. The elite has to Hinduise or be disowned by India- no two ways about this. What is missing is a proper Hindu elite and a leadership emerging from it. So all Hindus should realize that Hindutva is doing the dog’s work of guarding the pasture. Rather than spit on the watch dog the elite must learn to work along with it, and not be subverted by the US or other external forces. The elite has to complement Hindutva rather than combatting it." \[[MT3](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/11/18/hindutva-ko-fek-do/), [TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/730240043902763008)\]
