## Stopping Abe's diseases
There is a good chance that we won't come to our senses, overthrow dumbocracy and react with sufficient decisiveness in time - in which case, the sun will set on us just as it did on the Roman empire beset by the zombie cult. This is the  "gone with a whimper" (worst) case, whose prognostication we may observe in the Kerala and W Bengal. This is a serious possibility, and the Gods have not granted idiots immunity from extinction.

And even if somehow we do come to our senses, it is likely to be after another huge setback (not a few hundred dead per year - more of the magnitude of a second or third partition).

## Literacy and hunger
To quote Vikram: "Hunger is widespread and pervasive in India, but affects only about 20 % of the population (and this proportion has been declining continuously). Also, India is the largest newspaper reading country in the world. The literacy rate is almost 75 % and steadily increasing."
