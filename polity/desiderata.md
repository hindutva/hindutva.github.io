## Desiderata (cross-national)
We are in favor of the following (subject to change):

- A strong revival of paganism (potentially bound by the meta-template of hinduism) as an alternative to the Abrahamic religions.
- Protection of individual freedom to the maximum possible extant.
    - Freedom of speech and its limits - see [here](../../polity/external-affairs/tolerance/).
    - Marijuana should be legalized and regulated - just like alcohol, tobacco, red bull and coffee.
        - Marijuana is less harmful than alcohol.
        - The system then has a better shot at preventing/ reducing negative effects.  
    - Gambling and prostitution should be legal and regulated.
        - The system then has a better shot at preventing/ reducing negative effects.
    - Homosexuality is not criminal.
        - Some people are born with homosexual tendencies (../More [here](../social-cultivation/deviance/)). Some may choose not to express them.  
    - Weapons.
        - It is against hindu tradition that good people should be unarmed.
- Broad-based economic development.
    - Taxation should be based on consumption, rather than earning/ income.
        - So, no corporate or individual income tax.
- An engaged (non-apathetic) citizenry.
    - Citizens are not stupid or lazy, but systems which invite participation (at the right level and in the right form) ought to be in place.  
        
- Good and efficient governance. This means low corruption, putting public good ahead of narrow interests.
    - Having an efficient and effective law enforcement apparatus.
- Prevention of animal cruelty, protection of sentient life. The earth is not ours alone.
    - This makes (commonly cruel) halaal slaughter illegal.
- Care for the environment, minimization of pollution.

### Legal protection for Hindu exclusivity
"At this point, one may raise the argument that the restrictions in the case of sabarimala are not left to the conscience of the worshipper but enforced and thus, this would impinge upon the freedom of the individual worshipper to practice the religion as he or she sees fit.
 
 The only real & truly honest response to this argument is that the temple is essentially the residence of the deity who is also the owner of the temple & is entitled to an absolute enjoyment of this property, as amply indicated by terms such as devasvam, devagRha, etc.
 
 But, wait? A deity is no “real person”. How can he/she enjoy this property? Well, if the law can recognize the personhood of a body corporate (a company), its right to own property & transact in its own name, nothing ought to prevent a similar recognition in the case of temples.
 
 There is a long, historical precedent (from both texts & inscriptions) allowing the recognition of a deity’s legal personhood, full ownership of its residence (& other properties) & freedom to decide how the residence ought to be accessed or enjoyed by other persons.
 
 In accordance with what is the deity’s will executed & implemented by the priests and/or management who are both, verily, the deity’s trustees? The Agama-s or relevant tantra-s or paddhati-s known to govern the temple from very inception or simply known as last remembered usage." {[GA18](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2018/07/22/a-short-discussion-on-pertinent-issues-presented-by-the-sabarimala-matter/)}

### Limitation

The views expressed below are subject to change. Our political views are not rigidly formed, but roughly you may say that it is "right of center".
