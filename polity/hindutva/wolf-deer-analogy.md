Some wolves were let loose among a pack of deer. They hunted in a pack as habitual predators, and started killing off the deer, picking on the young and vulnerable first.

The deer appealed to the State for protection. State said wolves are a minority, *they* will be protected. But but said the deer, it is we who need protection. We do not interfere with the wolves, we leave them alone, but they don't. But the State was unmoved. All species are equal, and minorities need protection.

Losing numbers, the deer decided to band together for protection. There was a tribe of bards, the narrative builders. They had power to influence the State. The deer appealed to them for help. But the bards had become corrupted. The wolves offered them a share of their deer kill. 

"Fascists" said the bards, "the deer are majoritarian fascists." 
Some stronger deer would guard the periphery. They had become aggressive to counter the wolves. They recalled their past valor.

The bards were getting less meat. You used to be such gentle creature said the bards. Remember your deer nature. Don't let the fascists corrupt it. One time a wolf was stalking a young deer to steal it. Ravenously hungry he got separated from the pack. As he was about to pounce on the youngling, a big deer with antlers charged him. Soon the herd gathered. "Lynching!" Shouted the bards. "The deer are lynching the wolves!"

"We get stalked, violated, killed every day said the deer. That is not lynching? When we try to protect ourselves it becomes lynching?" "It's just the news cycle said the bards. Wolf eats deer is no news, it is their nature. But when deer kill a wolf, that is news. Don't blame us." "Your problem is not the wolves", said the bards, "the problem are the guardian deer. They have corrupted your gentle nature. Before that everything was peaceful." "Be good deer", said the bards. "Don't be bad like the guardian deer. That will solve all your problems." The bards were very influential and some deer got swayed. Soon the deer starting fighting amongst each other. Some turned against the guardian deer.

As bards shouted “lynching” the State also started acting against the guardian deer. Soon there was no one to protect the deer. The wolves loved it. Meat was plentiful. They made short work of the herd.  As only a few deer were left they appealed to the State. We are the minority now, please protect us. Minority is based on entire forest said the State. Wolves are still a minority who need protection. The deer herd was completely wiped out. The last few younglings were ravaged by the wolves in a gang, taking delight as they were ripped to shreds. The bards were silent.

But the wolves got hungry again and there were no more deer. So they started attacking the bards. The bards had always showed wolves as victims, many stayed silent as the bards were attacked. One the verge of death, one bard let out a plaintive cry, "we helped you all this time, now you attack us?" "We are just acting per our nature", said the wolf, as he slit the bard’s neck.
