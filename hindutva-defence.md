## Summaries of Hindutva

> Hindutva = Hinduness.
> Hindutva = Hinduism that resists bigotry, hatred & attacks against Hinduism & Hindus. 
> Hindutva is a word weaponized by bigots to attack Hindus & hide their hatred & bigotry.
> They want Hindus to reject their Hinduness & not resist bigotry & hatred against them.
> - Jonathan West.

> Why is the religion of Christians Christianity whereas that of Hindus Hinduism, or Jains Jainism etc? We should deny that Christian exception. Plus, Hindutva, by grammar, means the essence of being a Hindu, and is therefore an apt native translation for a fallacious Hinduism. 
> - Sarvesh Tiwari

> Hindutva : Philosophy of those Hindus who refuse to bend over and be meekly butchered!
> - Shefali Vaidya


> "even though Hindutva may appear corny to the elite it is an upwelling of the India’s true spirit- the Americans know it and are trying to stanch it. ... What is missing is a proper Hindu elite and a leadership emerging from it. So all Hindus should realize that Hindutva is doing the dog’s work of guarding the pasture. Rather than spit on the watch dog the elite must learn to work along with it... The elite has to complement Hindutva rather than combatting it." - MT

> US = cultivated liberalism over fundamentally illiberal base.
> Hindutva = cultivated hardening over liberal base.
