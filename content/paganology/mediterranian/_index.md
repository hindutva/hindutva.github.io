        - Later survived among copts.
- Minoans (-> Eteocretans) with Linear A script

### Greece and Rome

- Ancient greeks with Linear B script.
- Deity similarities
    - "In the Roman religion the “indra-like deity” was represented by Iuppiter: an etymological cognate of Indo-Aryan dyauH-pitR^i and Greek Zeus Pater (vocative: dyauH pitaH and Zeu Pater;)." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/some-comparative-considerations-on-the-indo-european-religion-with-a-focus-on-the-roman-religion/)\]
    - "Mars had functional and iconographic similarity to kumAra the deity of para-Vedic provenance, who became a major deity among the Indo-Aryans starting from the latest-Vedic period. ... An interesting feature of the iconography of Mars was his non-human representation in the form of a spear. This was particularly important in the Regia, the office of the senior-most ritualist (Pontifex Maximus; Footnote 2), which lay between the temple of Vesta (where the Roman equivalent of the gArhapatya fire was housed) and the memorial of Julius commissioned by Augustus." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/some-comparative-considerations-on-the-indo-european-religion-with-a-focus-on-the-roman-religion/)\]
- Ritual language preservation
    - "The ritual also included the chanting of the Saliaria Carmina which were ancient incantations which were part of the Roman “shruti”. They were composed in an ancient form of Italic that predated Latin and their text was faithfully handed by the ritualists along with their correct oral form. By the classical Roman period few understood their meaning they were learned by rote and deployed in the ancient language even as the ancient language of the veda is deployed by the Hindu ritualists." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/some-comparative-considerations-on-the-indo-european-religion-with-a-focus-on-the-roman-religion/)\]
- Depopulation ([SP15](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/627290343080390656/photo/1), [BVP15](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/r4wVQaLJD7o/nUwnh_faIQAJ))
    - Emperor Augustus would introduce legislation to increase the birthrates of the Roman nobility.
- Jewish intolerance to Greko-Roman ways
    - Forget the the horror stories of the Talmud for the moment, look up the Kitos war waged by diaspora u1's, also look up tacitus histories wherein he records jewish proselytism and fanaticism. Prior to that john hyrcanus. \[[EG](http://egregores.blogspot.ca/2009/09/constantine-brief-history-of.html)\]  
        
    - "For the worst rascals among other peoples,15 renouncing their ancestral religions, always kept sending tribute and contributions to Jerusalem, thereby increasing the wealth of the Jews; again, the Jews are extremely loyal toward one another, and always ready to show compassion, but toward every other people they p183feel only hate and enmity. ... Those who are converted to their ways follow the same practice, and the earliest lesson they receive is to despise the gods, to disown their country, and to regard their parents, children, and brothers as of little account.  However, they take thought to increase their numbers; for they regard it as a crime to kill any late-born child..." - Tacitus \[[T1](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Histories/5A*.html)\]

## Heroes

  - A friend of the great Sallustius.
  - Of him, Libanius said: "I have mentioned representations (of Julian); many cities have set him beside the images of the gods and honour him as they do the gods. Already a blessing has been besought of him in prayer, and it was not in vain. To such an extent has he literally ascended to the gods and received a share of their power from him themselves."
- Porphyry, the Greek, author of the brilliant “Against the Christians”, who was beaten up by a Christian mob in Caesarea, Palestine. \[[M](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/)\]
- Proclus (Πρόκλος), the mathematician, and the last RShi of the yavana-s, who [preserved](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens) for some time the statue of Athena uprooted in 435 CE by the edict of the rascal Theodosius.
- Martyrs such as Porphyry (author of "Against the Christians"), Hypatia - who were murdered by Christians.
