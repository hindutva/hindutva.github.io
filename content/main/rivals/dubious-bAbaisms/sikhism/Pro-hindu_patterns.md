## In texts
- arjun-deva, 5th in line after nAnaka, was pro-veda and pro-smRti. Arjan dev's shabads form the bulk of granth sahib.

### Heavy brAhmaNa contribution
- Almost 50% (16/36) of authors of Guru Granth Sahib were Brahmins. This includes the 11 Bhatts and 5 Bhagats (Beni, Jayadeva, Surdas, Ramanand, Parmanand). And before anybody says "but oh they were Sikhs". No, they were not. The Bhagats lived before the advent of Sikhism.  The descendants of the families of Bhatts have not accepted Amrit and initiated into Khalsa order.


## Identification as hindus
### Tegh BahAdur
Guru Tegh Bahadur visited the holy Triveni at Prayaga in 1662 CE. This visit is documented in contemporary Bhat Vahi records. Unlike those unpublished "bhat vahis", this one was published by Sikh historian Madanjit Kaur (1978). This Bhat Vahi was signed by Guru Tegh Bahadur.

The content of the letter is particularly striking.

- Guru Tegh Bahadur calls himself a devotee of Naina Devi. Note. A devotee of Naina Devi. He does not mention Akal Purakh or Waheguru
- In the record, Guru Tegh Bahadur identifies himself as Sodhi Khatri by Varna and Kaushish by gotra. This is exactly how the followers of orthodox Hinduism identify themselves to this date!
- Further, Guru Tegh Bahadur appoints a brahmin purohit named Bhoj Raj. He orders Sodhis of his line and all his Sikh followers to obey the aforementioned Brahmin Purohit. This practice of appointing purohits is just what is referred to by some people as "Brahmanical Hinduism"

This evidence, which marks Guru Tegh Bahadur as strikingly Hindu, is also corroborated by other Sikh accounts. Kavi Santokh Singh's Sri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth preserves a very rare passage which throws light on what Guru Tegh Bahadur uttered in Mughal court. When the Guru was offered the choice of Islam or dεath in the Mughal court, this is what he said

> "I believe my Hindu Dharma to be most superior.  
How can I abandon that which is most dear to me?  
Which gives so much happiness in this world & that,  
Life is nothing before honour."  

Further, Guru Tegh Bahadur calls himself the "Guru of Hindus" and not "Guru of Sikhs". He says:

> "They imprisoned me, the Guru of Hindus,  
Whatever I said, they listened not"  

These (screenshots) are excerpted from the highly acclaimed historical Sikh chronicle Guru Pratap Suraj Granth( written c.1843 CE) and can be accessed online.

Finally, the Guru's own passages preserved in Guru Granth Sahib corroborate that the Guru was every inch a Hindu. He says- "This is the blessing of Vedas and Puranas, that you may meditate in the name of Hari"

## Limited defence
- Shikhs are falsely protrayed as a sword arm of hinduism. This exaggerates their relatively minor role relative to, say, the marATha-s; and underplays the real strong hindu influences on the later Sikh elite (like ranjit singh).

### Govinda-siMha
> "Among other things, Govind assures Aurangzeb that he is just as much an idol-breaker as the Padeshah himself: “I am the destroyer of turbulent hillmen, since they are idolators and I am the breaker of idols.” Aurangzeb was sufficiently pleased with the correspondence (possibly several letters) he received from the Guru, for he ordered Wazir Khan not to trouble Govind any longer. ... So far, it is hard to see where the Sikhs have acted as the sword-arm of Hinduism against Islam. If secularism means staying on reasonable terms with both Hindus and Muslims, we could concede that the Gurus generally did steer a “secular” course. Not that this is shameful: in the circumstances, taking on the Moghul Empire would have been suicidal." \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2011/12/guru-tegh-bahadurs-martyrdom.html)11\]
