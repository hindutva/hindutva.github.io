## Problems
### General summary
Many news outlets (English, Muslim etc.) have a very anti-hindu and anti-India bias. Hindus find it a complete (often painful) waste of time to even look at their articles, if they are about Hindus or India.

To quote [@nntaleb](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1103000712970158086): 
- “Newspapers have officially the right facts, but their interpretations are imaginary – and their choice of facts are arbitrary. They lie with right facts; a novelist says the truth with wrong facts.”, and
- “Every single fact in the NYT is true. Every bit of news is flase.”

### Fake news
- Opindia publishes periodic fake news reports covering prominent rags from Indian and abroad. See the [examples page](../opindia_fake_news_examples_16_18/).
- Some prominent examples: 
    -  Fake dalit rape petition - Amnesty international - [AmnRap15](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/amnesty-fuelling-the-indian-rape-myth/17406#.VfMlFrMM_Bc.twitter). (Compare with associated nonsense in famous rags - [img](http://i.imgur.com/eMTDF5E.png) )
    - Dalit killed and set ablaze - false \[ [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/0Vz6rKX.jpg)15\]

### Bias in fact selection
- Sensationalism whenever a relatively pro-hindu (BJP) government is in power is observed.

Examples:
- Singling out hindus for curtailment of freedom of speech
  - [2015NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/opinion/sunday/sonia-faleiro-india-free-speech-kalburgi-pansare-dabholkar.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=opinion-c-col-top-region&region=opinion-c-col-top-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-top-region). (It is not just hindu-s who attack it (unlike what these mlecCha rags would have you and others believe) - but also christians (take contemporaneous [IE nun threat](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/twist-in-nun-play-row-director-says-he-fears-for-his-life/) ) and muslims.

### Blowing problems out of proportion
- There is "oppression olympics" with the more allegedly oppressed group getting more press.

### Hindu-s as idots.
- Various rags keep sensationalizing (even caricaturing) pro-hindu stances by misrepresenting them and drawing false equivalences. They do this without honest about being caricatures.
- Soemtimes, a pro-hindu person that takes it for an attempted demonstration of absurdity can go and point out the misrepresentation.
  - In my (pre-Modi) experience, many news outlets which publish silly anti-hindu pieces don't do that - they disallow all pro-hindu comments; or adapt a more sinister strategy - disallow all intelligent and measured pro-hindu comments while allowing ones with bad grammar and abuses.

## Utility
### Not good for?
- Facts
- Assessment of national or hindu mood [A-1903](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2019/03/06/comments-on-nyts-after-india-loses-dogfight-to-pakistan/).
- What powerful people think. They don’t even tell us what people in power in angospheric countries (presidents, diplomats etc..) think.
  - During the 201903 anti-JEM Indian air strike, BBC and NYT were saying stuff to the effect that Imran Khan won some propaganda battle against Modi ([VJ’s quote](https://twitter.com/VamseeJuluri/status/1101684213714046976)) – even as India attended the Organization of Islamic Countries as the “Guest of Honour”, despite Pakistan’s attempt to disinvite India and refused to include Kashmir in its resolution till Pakistanis forced it in.
  

### Good for?
#### Anglospheric perspective
It is natural for NYT, Newyorker, BBC etc.. to write from the perspective of USA/ leukosphere: “We wanted to use this third world country against China but they are so incompetent, backwards”, “Oh look! Modi is a fascist, muslims are in such a pitiful state” ([Vamsee Juluri’s Newyorker quote](https://twitter.com/VamseeJuluri/status/1103120584274173953) ) etc.. Which is why they are good to gauge the mood of liberal-minded people of mlecCha-deshas – but not much else.

## Causes
- Ideological anti-hindu bias - socialist, leftist, islamic, leukospheric etc..
  - Audience expectations.
- Some of it is due to the mlecCha-s' lack of context combined with undue vehemence - also discussed [here](../academia/charges/).
- Money - sensationalism sells.


### Psy-ops connection

- Who pulls the strings deep behind the scenes? See the [psyops page](../../polity/sick-india/subversion/).
- Prominent examples from the past
    - Spanish American war 19cen ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_the_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War)).
