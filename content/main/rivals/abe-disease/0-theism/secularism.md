title: Secularism
---

## Intro
- Secularist argument: "If your religious faith requires you to enforce its tenets on those who are not members of your faith-community, then your religion is incompatible with a free society and society has a right to defend itself against such encroachment."
- Secularism, being in some sense "softer" in appearance to harder anti-theism and Abrahamisms, is insidious and dangerous from the heathen perspective. Hence it merits a separate page.
- Alternative phrases that helps us understand secularism better
    - sickularism
    - (via [Ambreesh](https://www.facebook.com/ambreesh.mishra)) \- post-christian christianism.
    - Dechristianized christianity (bAlagangAdhara) \[[hipkapi](http://www.hipkapi.com/2011/03/03/the-religion-of-secular-state-dechristianized-christianity-s-n-balagangadhara/)\]
    - Secularism is the new state/ political religion. - Sandeep B.
    - Poison to heathens and rejection of their "superstitions".

### Anti-nationalism
Secularism sometimes manifests as anti-nationalism - as in the case of opposition to state shinTo of Japan or hindutva of India. There is here an explicit rejection of a (quasi-)deified national spirit (kokutai of the japanese, or bhArata-mAta of hindus). Origins of such rejection are considered in a separate section. 

## Origins
- The notion of secularism emerged from conflicts and compromise involving strains of Abrahamist monotheism either on both sides (as in the case of Europe) or one one side (as in the case of some strains of sikh thought).
- This is then a universalization of a phenomenon of limited local relevance - "Were secularism to be seen as not only a product of the West, but also having characteristics that link it to the ongoing religious traditions of the Christian West, then its universal applicability would be questionable." \[[Mohr13](https://www.academia.edu/1549528/2_The_Christian_origins_of_secularism_and_the_rule_of_law)\]
- Also note its close connection to modern reactionary epistemological atheism (described [here](abe-disease/zombie-cult/)) given its rejection of and scorn for pagan state ritual.
- Poor background - Secularists and anti-nationalists oft come from a secular background deprived of a pagan national setup - as such they are more driven by prejudices and lack of imagination than solid experience.
- *Lack of sympathy and loyalty* towards the interest of fellow pagans.  

### Anti-nationalism
Anti-nationalism is often found in Abrahamists since pagan states oppose their impositions, as well as in some pagans of Abrahamistic background (native or acquired). A prominent example involves western converts to shinto ("my green shinto rejects jingoist state shinto") or hinduism (yogis against hindutva). This problematic attitude sometimes arises from the below (in addition to the common factors motivating "secularism"):

- Basic misunderstanding - "A nationalist people are naturally a nasty people who are belligerent berserkers. A deified national spirit cannot be benevolent, friendly or subordinate towards other nations or bigger regions."
- Conflict of interest - "A japan with state shinto, or an India with state hindutva result in strong states which can outcompete and harm the interests of my host/ native/ favorite country or culture."
- Guilt misplaced
  - How can one benefitting from "freedom of religion" (even theoretical equality!) granted by monotheist societies deny it to monotheisms in pagan nations?
- Virtue signalling and marketing
  - "I am an enlightened being - not like those hateful white supremacist ultra-nationalists spoiling the name of paganism."

## Problems
### Undeserved religious "equality"

- Equation of inimical barbarian religions with national cultural traditions.
- Secularism fosters a false sense of equality between the national pagan culture and the barbarian abrahamisms (which are not even comparable, being as different as an orange is to a brinjal). This brings exclusivist, poisonous dogmas to the fore, and offers them deference and legitimacy.
- The local cultural traditions obviously have contributed a lot more to the distinctiveness and the soul of the nation. Barbarian religions (esp. abraham's madnesses), by contrast, will have harmed more than enriched the national culture and security.
- This false sense of equality spreads like fire through the minds of the unwary pagan populace - especially its idiot segments.

#### Proselytization problem

- License to proselytize and subvert puts the abrahamisms at an even greater advantage.
- "From a human perspective an invading pathogen is abnormal; from the pathogen's perspective it's perfectly normal." –Zinsser
- It is taken to be a license to proselytize and subvert the weakest and stupidest sections of pagan society.
- This puts heathen traditions like hinduism and shinto at a disadvantage. To counter them, they are forced to pervert themselves and develop proselytizing arms.
- See the [stubborn minority principle here](../../../../polity/external-affairs/tolerance/).
- This is especially true today: " there are inevitably nay-sayers, non-theists, secular-pagans and the like who pounce in proudly with “but there were non-polytheists in the ancient world too.” They will bring up pantheism, monism, atheism and the like as though this somehow strengthens their attempts to dismantle our traditions. ... I think the time has come to address some of this ideological undercutting because while what they say is technically accurate, it is presented without context and that context is important. We live in a very different world from our polytheistic ancestors. We are an occupied people. Our world is doggedly, demonstrably, and sometimes violently monotheistic. ..." \[[krasskova16](https://krasskova.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/the-battle-for-polytheisms-soul/)\]

### De-sacralization
- Destruction of the national (and cultural) spirit by de-(spi)ritualization of government is a consequence of secularism. State and group rituals, however, are an essential part of pagan expression. Secularism forces this pagan cultural expression out of the public space.
    - Examples: saxony \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/582162695127994370)\], shinTo, hindus (rAjasUya etc..).
- Separation of the spiritual from the secular perverts heathen culture.
    - This separation is absent in heathen cultures. By forcing this upon them, the abrahAmists weaken and pervert heathen expression.
    - Separating artistic feeling from science - "This dichotomy between religiosity and secular pursuits is a feature of the dominant mode of thought in the Leukosphere arising partly out of their religion (Christendom and orthodox-jewry stand mostly at cross purposes with Science)."  \[[MT](https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmanasataramgini.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F02%2F10%2Fthe-end-of-the-heathens%2F&h=iAQF6fwII&s=1)\] Part of "Secularism" then has come to mean that religiosity should be kept out of acceptable scientific discourse in general. This has been internalized by Macaulay's children.

### Institutionalized scorn for heathenry.
- Secularism continues Abrahamistic thought patterns that are inimical and scornful to heathens and their "superstitions".
  - \[[JG](http://library.fora.tv/2008/05/24/John_Gray_in_Conversation)\] 
  - Examples: - History with a purpose, future being better than the past, culminating in some sort of ecstatic utopia. \[Seen in millennarianism, which is ought to be accomplished by divine power, and often by war - Syria 2014, Lybia 2013, Iraq, afghAnistan.\]
- Nearly all "secularism" ultimately is the result of an abrahamistic struggle (internecine or otherwise), which is very different from the pagan context.
- "This meme is peculiar in many ways- it is antagonistic in being exterior to religion as defined by Christo-Islamism, but is in its interior a twin of the religion meme of Leukosphere and sustained by very similar doctrinal constructs. Most importantly their system of ethics in secularism derive directly from the core Abrahamistic meme. The scorn for heathens is also inherited..." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/09/western-generalizations-of-religiosity/)\]
- There is often a continuation of thought patterns of the abrahamisms. 

### Sapping national strength
A nation imbued with a strong national spirit and cult is a strong nation, one which can effectively solve internal conflicts and face external threats. For example, a strongly hindu India can better face jihAds from the neighboring Muslim states, land-lust of China, divide-and-rule attempts of Anglosphere while tackling domestic problems of similar communist, Islamic or missionary nature.
