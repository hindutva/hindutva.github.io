title: Iconoclasm
---

## General pattern
### Saints and martyrs
- Many saints were criminals. "St" Boniface chopped down Thor's Oak sacred to Germanics, "St" Nicholas said to have done same in Lycia to Hellenic sacred trees, "St" Martin did same (later Dutch Protestants defaced his cathedral)
- If you read martyr stories, you find saints going up and destroying shrines and icons, and then threatening to come back with a crusader army if the pagans refuse to convert. Then they get killed by pagans, which the Christians describe as the unjustified murder of an innocent.
- "The Christain saints and missionaries like Cyril and Bonerface were part communist "community organizer" and part Taliban death squad leader."
- "There was a 1583 revolt in Goa (then under Portuguese) called Cuncolim revolt where the locals killed missionaries going around destroying temples, they were turned into "martyrs" & beatified."

### Digestion
- Digestion of icon-worship and polytheism within Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Christianity
    - In Catholicism there are many angels and saints, whose icons are worshiped, sometimes infused with prechristian rites, identities and traits.

- The charity route \[Julian [TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/894579184487481344)\]
- Libanius - "hasten to attack the temples with sticks and stones and bars of iron, and in some cases, disdaining these, with hands and feet. Then utter desolation follows, with the stripping of roofs, demolition of walls, the tearing down of statues and the overthrow of altars, and the priests must either keep quiet or die. After demolishing one, they scurry to another, and to a third, and trophy is piled on trophy, in contravention of the law. Such outrages occur even in the cities, but they are most common in the countryside. Many are the foes who perpetrate the separate attacks, but after their countelss crimes this scattered rabble congregates and they are in disgrace unless they have committed the foulest outrage. Temples, Sire, are the soul of the countryside: they mark the beginning of its settlement, and have been passed down through many generations to the men of today."

- "One of the ways the Christians prevented Greeks to visit their temples/shrines was to build cemeteries around them or to bring bones into the temples. The 'pollution' of the dead around the temples kept people away." Example: Cornith 5Ce - [IMG](https://imgur.com/es9877w.jpg).
