TL;DR : Muslim society is undesirable, despite a supposedly tolerant yet silent majority.

  

## Disclaimers and clarifications

- Personal Disclaimer:
    - I am not saying that all muslims are bad people - many are sensible enough not follow the example of their prophet or strictures of Qur'an. Yet, I say that Islam is a vile ideology.
    - Please don't presume to psychoanalyze me and read hatred of muslims. On the contrary, I have no problems empathizing with Muslims at a human level. It is by a good accident of birth that I was not born a muslim. I grew up with muslim friends, and have had many polite (sometimes frank) conversations with muslims.
        - I have received help from and have helped muslims. Further, I understand that Islam is not the only motivator of the good and bad actions of muslims.
- Our judgement of Islam is not restricted to what its liberal or the terrorist extremes do - it includes the entire spectrum (= probability distribution) of behavior observed in Muslims and Muslim societies.

## Undesirability of Muslim society

- Muslim society has a pernicious effect on non-muslim (../especially polytheistic) societies. These are detailed in a [separate section](constituent-subversion/).
- A muslim society is, in the long term, bad for the muslim population itself, due to:
    - Misogyny taking many forms: Forced veil for women, Taharroush rape game, female genital mutiliation.
    - Opposition to free spirited scientific enquiry in general. Consequently, we have:
        - Lowering of fitness and IQ of offspring due to obstinate inbreeding (pAkistAni muslims vs bAnglAdeshis and Indians [here](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-cost-of-inbreeding-in-terms-of-health/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=the-cost-of-inbreeding-in-terms-of-health).)
    - Islam is bloody within and without. So, muslims tend to fight each other to death about what "true islam" is and who is a "heretic".
    - Opposition to joy of many types, and increase in "victimless crimes" at worst, or a schizophrenic acceptance at best extending to even allowance of child abuse (eg. stringed instruments, homosexuality [here](https://storify.com/Parikramah/history-of-lgbt-flourishing-within-islam), bestiality [here](http://i.imgur.com/4K2jDFq.jpg)).

#### Political demography of muslims

[![](http://i.imgur.com/xczglD1.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/xczglD1.jpg)

  

- In a muslim society, these numerous tolerant muslims tend not to successfully challenge those idiots that stick to their constitution (Quran, Hadith etc..) - as observing Terrorist state of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia etc.. (as of 2014) will reveal. Rather, they tend to mostly cooperate (with or without misgivings) in heinous acts. So, it certainly matters what the RoP holy books say.
    - Ridiculous fatwas (judicial opinions of mullah-s/ ulema-s) continue to be issued \[See[Arun Shourie's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iVIec5e3_0&feature)\] around the muslim world. Yes, this "high literature" does influence the lives and attitudes of muslims.
        - Examples: Opinions on [beating women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty-q9GTure4), sex slaves (Details in a separate section).
    - Sharia policing within (even minority) muslim communities and neighborhoods.
        - Societies such as [Tablighi Jamat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablighi_Jamaat) (India) enforce retrograde mores among the muslim ummah.
        - In a [German city](http://www.dw.de/locals-concerned-as-sharia-police-patrol-streets-of-german-city/a-17904887).
    - WikiIslam statistics [here](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Muslim_Statistics).
- Classifying muslims by Islamism.
    - Many muslims are good despite their religion. Not every Nazi party member during WW2 was actually a bad person - there were even the likes of Oskar Schindler - similar is the case with Muslims.
        - Eg: [dharmadeen list](http://dharmadeen.com/),[gay imam](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/gay-muslim-imam-brings-message-of-tolerance-to-europe-a-985863.html#spRedirectedFrom=www&referrrer=http://t.co/EC09h1pcc4).
        - But, their "moderation" has very weak theological basis/ solid clerical support, as explained in a separate section.
    - Islamists vs Jihadists
        - Islamists are in favor of establishing a muslim state and curb infiedels "eventually"; but they are not willing to start or participate in a revolution to accomplish it "right now". Jihadists, on the other hand, want to do it \*now\* and are willing to kill/ die for it.
            - Jihadi kid in kAshmIra [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgFPt1FqulE).
        - "Salafis are not jihadists, and most adhere to sects that reject the Islamic State. They are, as Haykel notes, committed to expanding Dar al-Islam, the land of Islam, even, perhaps, with the implementation of monstrous practices such as slavery and amputation—but at some future point. Their first priority is personal purification and religious observance, and they believe anything that thwarts those goals—such as causing war or unrest that would disrupt lives and prayer and scholarship—is forbidden." \[[ISIS_A](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
- Estimates of the percentage of people with radical beliefs in muslim population is at 15-25%, even if the fraction of people who work outside the system to act on them (by terrorizing others) is smaller.

#### Analysis of effect on fitness

- Summary by @rjrasva
    - When Mohammedans r embedded in a population enthralled by limp ideologies liberalism, feminism, objectivism etc. It can actually enhance /1   the fitness of a # of them & their group. **Kufr produces wealth for them to produce kids**, or they may be inspired to acts of jihad like /2   capturing kufr women & produce kids thru them. (Parallel in early christianity - [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/yluN9Ak.png))
    - Of course they may also be inspired to acts of ghazawat like the London fellow, if he had /3   no kids, then his act would have nullified his fitness though **the meme would have spread itself by inspiring more to become ghazis**.
    - But /4   **as the kufr population diminishes, the benefits also come down** as less kufr to produce wealth for him to feast on, less kufr women to /5   capture etc.
    - Eventually the **returns may become -ve after every1 becomes Mohammedan** as they will then turn to slaughtering each other on /6   who the \*true\* Mohammedans r. 
    - There is also the **pyramid scheme element**, those who enter earlier (e.g. Arabs) get greater benefits. Thus a /7   recent Black African convert will enter as a lowly foot soldier, he won't be getting a train full of bibi's like the arab sheikhs. Recent /8   e.g. is IS using subcontinental recruits for toilet cleaning or tricking them into suicide bombings while giving > status to Arabs. /end
- "1) **When there is a large uninfected population in the vicinity then infection by khilimoha might benefit the individua**l because it induces him to perform acts of ghazwat that allows him to capture women from the uninfected and increase his fitness by fathering offspring on them. However, as this population decreases then there are diminishing returns for ultimately the sex ratio always tends to 1. A situation much like there being few or no bacteria in their given space of existence that lack the bacteriocin plasmid. No fitness gain, perhaps only loss. But this might trigger warfare within the khilimohita population resulting in deaths that could bring down fitness." \[[MT13](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/)\]
- "2) If an uninfected individual voluntarily contracts khilonmAda hoping that it might enhance his fitness, in most cases this was unlikely to be the case. For much of its existence khilonmAda ran as a pyramid scheme. Those who got it first benefit the most and at the expense of those who got in latter. For example, if a guy decided to become **khilonmadita he is most likely to enter as a lowly ajlaf rather than as an ashraf, a sheikh or an amir**. Indeed he was most likely to be cannon fodder who became a shahid with nullified fitness in a Jihad rather than being the recipient of a train of bibi-s to spend his nights enhancing his fitness. This situation is illustrated on multiple occasions in the history of marUnmAda in the subcontinent of jambudvIpa. For example, at the root of the split of the Bahmanid empire in Southern India was the conflict between the Deccani marUnmatta-s and the amirs and sheikhs arriving from the maru and central Asia. Despite having become marUnmatta-s the Deccanis were hardly getting much traction in terms of accruing benefits that might enhance their fitness – these instead went to the big beards arriving from abroad. Closer to our times one could cite the example of how Sajid Mir enhanced his fitness while his infected stooges, the merry Bombay blasters, brought theirs down to zero. Here, their fitness erasure was directly induced by the khilonmAda but their brains being spilled on the streets of Mumbai did not damage khilonmAda in any serious way." \[[MT13](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/)\]
- "One could argue that the infection of a group by khilonmada provides a **virtual kin marker**, i.e. makes them feel like an in-group against the background of uninfected individuals who have no specially identity. This situation might be compared to certain mobile genetic elements encoding proteins that allow organisms to distinguish themselves from their conspecifics and act beneficially towards and self-sacrifice for others bearing the same genetic element but not the general background of conspecifics. This could initially enhance the fitness of that group infected by that genetic element as opposed to those which are not. But in this group selection scenario the individual’s fitness is not necessarily raised but those of the group and the khilimoha meme-complex are. This might **help survival of the group in the short term but as everyone in the niche becomes infected then the utility of the meme-complex for the group diminishes or vanishes**. The infection of the Chechens in the Caucasus could be presented as an example of this. The reason it seems to work well for them is that they are surrounded by a large population of the uninfected. The same phenomenon might also be invoked in the case of accommodation of marUnmAda by parameshvara in Malaysia, the eventual conversion of his son late in is life and the events set in motion by it in the far east. In this context one could also bring up the case of the pA~nchanada-uShnIShamoha. This moha emerged as result of part but not whole of the khilimoha infecting the Hindu population of the pa~nchanada. The result was the emergence of a new recombinant memetic virus, the uShnIShamoha that retained the self-propagating tendencies of the original khilimoha. This infection was very mild in terms of fitness reduction, but provided a strong virtual kin marker that allowed the infected group to prevail and spread at the expense of the Hindus of the pa~nchanada also offered protection to the infected against being overrun by the spreading khilimoha. But as its numbers increased its utility as such a virtual kin marker diminished. Nevertheless, it continues to serve this purpose to a degree in new areas colonized by its carriers, such as North America." \[[MT13](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/)\]
- \[[MT13](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/)\] "Would it make sense for individuals from a well-structured heathen society to get infected by the khilimoha? Would it enhance their fitness?"
    - "There is a romantic view presented by apologists of the khilimoha that it helped emancipate the lower rungs of the social pyramid of heathen societies that were assailed by it. What is not told (in large part because of other modern constructs) is that the old well-structured heathen societies were reasonably well-adapted for their chosen lifestyles. Their pyramidal structure was not in large part a system for exploitation of those at the bottom by those at the top but more of a meritocracy contingent on the genetic foundations of their human resources. Thus, those at the bottom of the hierarchy were often enriched in traits that would preclude high power cognitive performance needed for complex tasks. Given this situation, their conversion to khilimoha would have hardly enhanced their fitness. If anything it might have depressed it by making them shahids for the jaysh al Islam. Moreover, khilonmAda has the quality of **destroying structure within societies it conquests** because it has a rather simple social model." \[[MT13](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/)\]
    - "Thus, conversion of individuals form a pagan society to the rAkShasamata results in their being **uprooted from their social scaffold** as well as, to a degree, their **organic connections to the land**. This could result in a reduction of their fitness. For example, the break down of Hindu social structure with the spread of Islam resulted in much lower capability to withstand famine from El Niño oscillations. Thus larger numbers of those who had converted to Islam in the Bahmanid sultanate perished (e.g. the durgAdevI famine)." \[[MT13](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/)\]
    - "This possibly explains why **most pagan societies fought the coming of the khilimoha tooth-and-nail** before it was forcibly thrust upon them by military defeat. If not, it seized them during period of social decline and breakdown – again a phenomenon prevalent during the take over of the far east. Finally, given that the rAkShasamata is bloody both within and without (to paraphrase Samuel Huntington) it confers an edge if it surrounded by and confronting memetically weakened competitors. However, if it is the only dominant force then it will **inexorably draw the society to a “basket case”** (think Somalia, Sudan and an Arab world without bhUmitaila) that might have a lower average fitness for an individual than a well ordered heathen society." \[[MT13](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/)\]

### Consciousness of demographic projection differences

- Erdogan to EU muslims: "make 5 kids" \[[E17](https://www.rt.com/news/381166-erdogan-turks-five-children/)\]  
    

## Roots of the badness.

### Why is moving beyond bad theology difficult in Islam?

- Islam is historicentric - very much reliant on the deeds and words of a historical person (rather than a deity), Muhammad - whose existence is not questioned by believers.
    - An ideology centered around this ideal muslim ("muhammad ul rasUl allaH"), a historic person, is fundamentally flawed.
    - Mythic elements are rather weak - unlike in Hinduisms, where we have an abundance of talking monkeys, bears and eagles, set in a mythic age. So, it is much harder to challenge the emulation-worthiness of the deeds of Muhammad.
    - The best case:
        - "Muslims can say that slavery is not legitimate now, and that crucifixion is wrong at this historical juncture. Many say precisely this. But they cannot condemn slavery or crucifixion outright without contradicting the Koran and the example of the Prophet. ... That really would be an act of apostasy." \[[ISIS_A](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
- Islam is highly text-centric: There is no part of their holy texts which declare that it is important to move beyond the texts \[check\].
- Later verses have precedence over earlier verses in Quran ([vid](https://youtu.be/vKXGcZlMK_k?t=1132)), in traditional Islam. So, the mostly-Meccan peace-verses are abrogated by the Medina intolerance-verses. Eg: "No compulsion in religion" vs verse of the sword.
- To judge RoP (religion of peace/ Islam) by its holy texts:
    - Muhammad is the ideal muslim. (Anyone blaspheming him is going to be in deep trouble in almost any muslim country.)
    - Muhammad was a horrible human being - a lecherous person, slaver and a mass murderer. (Look at his life stories, starting with the [banu qurayza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Qurayza) massacre.)

### Islamic jurisprudence

- Current Islamic jurisprudence \[[Distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Madhhab_Map2.png)\] largely affirms the purported intolerant attitudes:
    - Prominent sunni schools
        - Hanbali jurisprudence is considered very strict and conservative, especially regarding questions of creed. Hanbali school holds that the two primary sources of Islamic law are the Qur'an and the prophetic tradition; the Hanbali school is known for its strong emphasis on verifying and utilizing the latter on equal ground with the former, whereas other schools granted the tradition a secondary role.
        - Hanafi : The sources from which the Hanafis derive Islamic law are, in order of importance and preference: the [Qur'an](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an), the authentic narrations of the Muslim prophet [Muhammad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad) ([hadith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith)), consensus of the Muslim community ([ijma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijma)), analogical reasoning ([qiyas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiyas)), juristic discretion ([istihsan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istihsan)) and the customs of the local population enacting said law ([urf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urf)).
        - Shafi'i: In hierarchical order, the usul al-fiqh consist of: the Quran, the Sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, ijmā' ("consensus"), and qiyas ("analogy").
        - Maliki:
            -  Mālik regarded the practices of Medina (the first three generations) to be a superior proof of the "living" sunnah than isolated, although sound, hadiths.
        - The Zahiri school of thought recognizes three sources of the Islamic law within the principles of Islamic jurisprudence. The first is the Qur'an, considered by Muslims to be the verbatim word of God; the second consists of the prophetic as given in historically verifiable reports, which consist of the sayings and actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad; the last is absolute consensus of the Muslim community.
    - Prominent shia schools
        - Jaʿfari school: The time and space bound rulings of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school. It differs from the four schools or [madhhabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab) of Sunni [jurisprudence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh) in its reliance on [ijtihad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijtihad), as well as on matters of inheritance, religious taxes, commerce, personal status and the allowing of temporary marriage or[mutʿa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikah_mut%E2%80%98ah).
        - Zaidiyyah: In matters of Islamic jurisprudence, the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn ’Ali's teachings which are documented in his book Majmu’ al-Fiqh.
        - Abathi
    - "These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular hadiths they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason (qiyas) in deciding difficulties."
- On the theological support of the jihAdi-s:
    - ISIS [justification](http://cnsnews.com/news/article/lauretta-brown/isis-commander-justifies-massacre-we-had-called-upon-yazidis-convert): “The Islamic State does its utmost for the repentance of any infidel – whether Yazidi, Crusader, or Jewish. We have been fighting for no other reason than to extract people from their kufr (unbelief) and to usher them into the fold of Islam.” The commander also had a message for Yazidis who have not converted to Islam: “We advise, or even beseech, the Yazidis to come down from the mountains and convert, first and foremost in order to save their souls from the Hellfire, and secondly, if they remain in the mountains, they will die of hunger and thirst.”
    - KE: "Thus, when Mohammed Atta, Mohammed Bouyeri and hundreds of other Muslim terrorists declare in their farewell letters/videos that their motive is Islam, we have to believe them. But when they talk about Islam, claiming that their own interpretation is the same as Prophet Mohammed’s, we have to ascertain for ourselves the truth of that claim. And then we find that Prophet Mohammed’s intention was indeed closer to al-Qaeda’s than to that of the Sufis, a movement which invokes Quranic authority but was quite unknown in Mohammed’s day."

### False hopes

- The [muta'zila movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27tazila), which tried to get to the position that the Quran is man-made and argued for rationality, was vanquished 10 centuries ago, and has not really resurged. Though, there are very small hopeful signs. 
    - Jihad Turk denies that the biographies of muhammad are reliable since they were written 200 years after his death, so he was not such a horrible person \[[Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oLjMaIR0-k)\]. But, his grounds are shaky elsewhere \[eg: [rebuttal](http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/exclusive-local-imam-misleads-interfaith-groups)\].
- Ahmadiyya-s are about as bad for pagans, despite their rejection by other muslims. Furqan Force ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furqan_Force)) fought India in 1949.

#### Sufi-s

- Sufi jihAd-monging
    - [The beauty and beast of sufism](http://www.chakranews.com/beauty-and-the-beast-of-sufism/2454) argues that sufi-ism has not been a great exception. It is a fine expose of the 'beast' (vs the beauty) of sufism - especially its track-record in bhArata.
    - [TW1](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/772644082866909184).
- Orthodoxy on fundamental Islamic tenets.
    - Philosophy
        - As Carl informs: "In Islamic philosophy, ahadiyyat refers to the 'Uniqueness' of Allah, and occurs commonly in very fundamental surahs like Ikhlas. Wahdaniyyat refers to the 'Oneness' of reality." Theologians like Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi used these two concepts in his formulation of an epistemological Wahdat-ash-Shuhood (oneness of creator and created only in the eyes of the witnesser) as opposed to the older ontological formulation of Wahdat-ul-Wujood (oneness of existence; ie creater and created are one). Wahdat-ul-Wujood might have permitted monism, polytheism or pantheism - but it has been opposed vehemently by islamic orthodoxy ([Muhammad Salah video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpUw5U5SYjU)). Most ideologues who do openly accept it take great pains to clarify that this does not deviate from the intolerant shariah.
    - "It is the orthodox strain of Sufism that got acceptance in the Muslim society, thanks to Imam Ghazzali. The deviant beshariyah Sufis often suffered brutal persecution and even death. " (kAmakoTi-maNDali [article](http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1417&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1).)
    - "The great Sufi saints of India—namely Nizamuddin Auliya, Amir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti and Jalaluddin et al.— held rather orthodox and intolerant views.... they had adopted musical sessions (sama) and dancing (raqs) in their rituals. However, when it came to the real question of Islam, they never took a stand against classical orthodoxy; they always put the Ulema ahead of them in religious matters." (kAmakoTi-maNDali [article](http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1417&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1).)
    - "The Shaikhs of the Naqshbandi Sufi silsilā filled with the indignation of Islamic zeal severely condemned these ways of Ulugh Beg. ... The Shaikhs of the Naqshbandi Sufi silsilā filled with the indignation of Islamic zeal severely condemned these ways of Ulugh Beg. ... However, the opposition from the Sufis and Ulema came to bite him eventually when his own son in a plot to seize power had him sentenced to death by the Sharia court and promptly beheaded. After his death his astronomical observatory was demolished along with his heretical art and his intellectual endeavors based on Greek ideas were condemned severely by the Sufi Khwājah Ahrār \[Footnote 2\] as being contrary to the right path."  
        \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/08/28/the-makings-of-islamic-science/)\]
- Successful undermining of hinduism/ paganism. 
    - Sufi-s often act as the "good cop" of Islam, when it comes to selling Islam to pagans. As BE [writes](http://bharatendu.com/2009/07/06/akbar-transition-5/): "The ulemA, the sultAn and the sUfI, now acted as if three columns of the vanguard of Islam, but like the three generals, while they acted in unison at war, internally they wrestled for supremacy over the other"
    - However, they did take to violence and vandalism to accomplish their mission at opportune times.
        - "One intriguing thing about Eaton is that his own research of the medieval literatures on Indian Sufis for his Ph.D. thesis, published in Sufis of Bijapur 1300–1700, failed to find any trace of peace in the views and actions of Sufis and in their method of conversion" (kAmakoTi-maNDali [article](http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1417&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1).)
        - According to al-Maqrīzī, it was sufi Sa'im al-Dahr who destroyed the Sphinx's nose when he found locals making offerings.
    - Incorporation of hindu practices, while remaining inimical to hindu-s.
        - Yoga was incorporated into sufiism - eg: Carl Ernst [here](http://www.unc.edu/~cernst/pdf/jras2.pdf), Baḥr al-ḥayāt (Ocean of immortality), an early 17th century Persian Sufi text on yoga [here](http://i.imgur.com/h9TsdOa.jpg).
    - Examples:
        - Wali sanga of Java ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wali_Sanga)).
        - Several sufi mystics in India - especially kAshmIr. Syed Ali bin Shahab-ud-Din Hamadani Abidi (../more on him [here](../../../history/heroes/)).

## "Islamic" Science

- "So in reality the so called “Islamic Science” was a venture of the pagan Neo-Platonists fleeing the terror of Isaism, and many of the early “Islamic intellectuals” like Thabit ibn Kurra were by their own admission Hellenistic pagans. In 529 AD the Hellenistic philosophers fleeing persecution by the Isaistic ruler Justinian fled to the Iranian king Khusrau Anushirwan, who granted them a safe haven. After he defeated the Christians, he imposed a clause in the peace treaty with Justinian that he must allow the religious freedom of the pagans in the Byzantine empire. Harran as a border town received considerable protection from the Iranian rulers and the Hellenistic pagans could develop their religion and science. While Islam destroyed the Iranian empire, it failed to impose itself on the pagans of Harran. It was from here that they spread out and seeded the Arabic world with their highly developed science and philosophy." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/08/28/the-makings-of-islamic-science/)\]
- "However, over time Islamic attitudes hardened. We see this even Al Biruni who is considered by many a moderate Islamic scientist. He sees the similarity between Neo-Platonism and the Hindu dharma, but sees both as errors." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/08/28/the-makings-of-islamic-science/)\]
- "Timur’s grandson, Ulugh Beg, unlike his father, is described by the Islamic chroniclers as not being a proper observer of Islamic ways and prone to heretical tendencies. He was an extraordinarily intelligent man and a noted scientist who is well known for his astronomical treatise, the zīj-i jadīd-i güregen. ... The Shaikhs of the Naqshbandi Sufi silsilā filled with the indignation of Islamic zeal severely condemned these ways of Ulugh Beg. ...

## Conversion

### How Islam attracts converts

- Examples of converts are noted [here](../../../../hinduism/benefits/).
- Philosophical simplicity
    - 1 jealous god who stands apart, 1 devil, 1 final prophet, simple afterlife and origin stories, almost no image veneration
- Simple practice
    - 5 things to do, 5 prayers, 1 fast
    - Rigid structure for those who seek it.
- Communal benefits and threats
    - A brotherhood among the ummah
    - By threats and love marriages.
- Anti hindu rhetoric
    - Attack "weak" points
        - "superstition and idol centric ritualism"

#### Forced conversions.

- The choice for polytheists in the mercy of muslim rulers was often: Convert or die, with an occasional option of "pay the discriminatory jizya tax".
    - Examples: Islamic State's ultimatum to Yazidis/ christians (2014) - \[Yazidi [appeal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNoP-tQ5mCw), [threat](http://www.theminorityreportblog.com/2014/08/10/isis-buries-500-yazidis-alive-orders-others-to-convert-to-islam-or-die/), [slaughter](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/18/us-iraq-security-yazidis-idUSKBN0GI1QK20140818?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews)\].

### Consequences

#### Racinomiscia = Hatred of one's cultural roots

- Islam is a sort of Arab-pride, militant anti-pagan movement.
- An example from a Bangladeshi author is [here](http://nabeelafsar.com/2014/05/27/islam-as-an-arab-pride-movement/). "In exploring my Bengali heritage, I felt short-changed by my Muslim upbringing. If I was to trust my family, it was as if my ancestors were feral dogs who had been civilized by the wonderful Arabs who brought them the miracle of Islam."  "Why was my family trying so desperately to reach the standard of Arabian Islam when their own cultural heritage was so much more powerful, so much more relevant to modern life, and so much older?" "The answer is that Islam condemns paganism and polytheism without fully understanding what those spiritual traditions actually are. And the people conquered by the Arabs, forced to adopt their new religion, inevitably adopted their prejudices too."
- As the great author of mAnasataraMgiNI says (I paraphrase): "Islam brings hatred-of-ones'-roots to its non-Arab votaries; Even when they lose the madness to secularize, the hatred-of-ones'-roots continues; for example secular citizens of the terrorist state of Pakistan".
- Ambedkar famously [pointed](http://www.ambedkar.org/pakistan/40C.Pakistan%20or%20the%20Partition%20of%20India%20PART%20II.htm) out:
    - As the invasions were accompanied with. destruction of temples and forced conversions, with spoliation of property, with slaughter, enslavement and abasement of men, women and children, what wonder if the memory of these invasions has ever remained green, as a source of pride to the Muslims and as a source of shame to the Hindus ?
    - The only way to make Hindustan homogeneous is to arrange for exchange of population. Until that is done, it must be admitted that even with the creation of Pakistan, the problem of majority vs. minority will remain in Hindustan as before and will continue to produce disharmony in the body politic of Hindustan.

## What can we do?

- Understand the enemy
    - Understand the relentless nature of the Islamic desire to be to overcome all non-muslims. 
    - Understand the glacial and whirlwind approaches of Islam. So, Islamo-fascism, like terrorism, is antifragile.
- Anticipate a long struggle
    - "Thus, any campaign with marūnmāda is not finished with the killing of this or that marūnmatta. Certainly, their prominent leaders need to be constantly targeted and comprehensively eliminated. But this in itself gets one nowhere closer to victory. Instead any group which wishes to survive marūnmāda needs to prepare itself for an arms-race on an evolutionary scale, like the ceaseless war between bacteria and their viruses which has been going on for more than three billion years." \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/07/09/a-geopolitical-package-july-2016/)\]

- Support subversion of Islam into a \*definitely\* more benign ideology.
    - No half-measures - this necessarily involves questioning and rejecting the authority of the quran and the hadith. One can claim things such as:
        - Much islamic scripture was composed centuries after muhammad's death. So, they should be rejected. (Eg. Tarek Fatah [here](http://tarekfatah.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-muslim-and-an-islamist/))
        - Islam was originally polytheist and tolerant, but was transformed by muslims after muhammad's death.
- Boldly speak the truth about Islamo-fascism.
    - Parodies
        - Islam of rasgolla ([WP15](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/12/06/welcome-to-the-true-islam/)).
