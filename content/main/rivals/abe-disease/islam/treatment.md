title: Treatment
---

## Broad goals
RoP is a memetic (ie mental) disease of epidemic proportions. It CANNOT coexist with devadharma in the long run- one WILL have to give way to another. Carriers of this memetic disease, ie muslims, should be urgently quarantined and treated with compassionate firmness. We may look at how other nations are dealing with the problem. As part of such efforts, fertility of the disease-ridden population should be severely contrained. The only language that the infected people understand and appreciate is one of solid firmness ([MBS_19](https://www.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-mohammad-bin-salman-defends-china-concentration-camps-muslims-1340592)).

### Disease awareness
- Understand the relentless nature of the Islamic desire to be to overcome all non-muslims. 
- Understand the glacial and whirlwind approaches of Islam. So, Islamo-fascism, like terrorism, is antifragile.
- Excuses such as "most muslims (ie the afflicted people) don't show severe symptoms - they are good normal people", "Sufi so great, all is joy, God is one, we are all brothers" etc.. are just techneques of fooling oneself.

### Anticipate a long struggle
- "Thus, any campaign with marūnmāda is not finished with the killing of this or that marūnmatta. Certainly, their prominent leaders need to be constantly targeted and comprehensively eliminated. But this in itself gets one nowhere closer to victory. Instead any group which wishes to survive marūnmāda needs to prepare itself for an arms-race on an evolutionary scale, like the ceaseless war between bacteria and their viruses which has been going on for more than three billion years." \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/07/09/a-geopolitical-package-july-2016/)\]
- NN Taleb on how to deal with such - [NNT16](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/776691991887347713) [NNT16](http://i.imgur.com/t0fFA6d.jpg). You should not look for mitigation, rather focus on eradication.

## Limited support to apostasy among muslims.
- Beware - ex-muslims oft carry over much of their anti-hindu / "anti-superstition" inflammation.

### Marriages (especially of women) with non-muslims

#### China
- State policy encourages inter-ethnic marriages; with promotional videos and all.


## Subvert
### Support subversion of Islam into a \*definitely\* more benign ideology.
- No half-measures - this necessarily involves questioning and rejecting the authority of the quran and the hadith. One can claim things such as:
- Much islamic scripture was composed centuries after muhammad's death. So, they should be rejected. (Eg. Tarek Fatah [here](http://tarekfatah.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-muslim-and-an-islamist/))
- Islam was originally polytheist and tolerant, but was transformed by muslims after muhammad's death.

### Boldly speak the truth about Islamo-fascism.
- Parodies
    - Islam of rasgolla ([WP15](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/12/06/welcome-to-the-true-islam/)).

## Non-muslim settlement
### China
- Since 2015, Xinjiang gained 2 million new “residents”, who have their household registration (hukou) outside of Xinjiang. They settled in Urumqi and in XPCC regions. 

## Fertility control

### China
- Han Chinese academics have long complained about "excessive" Uyghur population growth, which they social instability and extremist religious thinking. But efforts to make the Han population dominant were set back by higher Uyghur birth rates, esp. in 2010s.
- Population growth rates in Xinjiang's minority regions plummeted in 2018, halving from 0.8% in 2017 to 0.4%. But in 2019, birth rates fell by a further 30-56%, and a Uyghur prefecture has set a near-zero growth target of 0.1% (!) for 2020. How? Through "family planning".  
- By 2019, Xinjiang planned to subject >80% of women of childbearing age in the southern minority regions to intrusive birth prevention surgeries (IUDs or sterilizations). In 2018, 80% of new IUDs in China were fitted in XJ (region only makes up 1.8% of national population). 
- Xinjiang’s stated goal is “zero birth control violation incidents” – not one child to be born outside the will of the state. Such targets are no joke. Hotan Prefecture, population 2.5m, could have exactly 21 birth control policy violations in 2019.
- "But the biggest shocker are two clandestine mass female sterilization programs in 2019 in Hotan City and Guma County. This is part of a "free birth prevention surgery" drive in rural minority regions, 2019 and 2020, funded with 260m RMB on regional level alone."
- "On May 30, 2018, Qiemo County (Bayingol Prefecture) issued a notice stating that violations that took place since July 28, 2017, and where women had exceeded the birth quota by two or more children, must "both adopt birth control measures with long-term effectiveness and be subjected to vocational skills education and training” ( tongshi caiqu changxiao jieyu cuoshi bingjin jinxing zhiye jineng jiaoyu peixun) (Qiemo County Government). The latter phrase is a euphemism for Vocational Training Internment Camps (VTICs), a common form of  extrajudicial internment (Journal of Political Risk, November 24, 2019). In Xinjiang, the term “birth control measures with long-term effectiveness" (changxiao jieyu cuoshi) essentially refers to either IUDs ( jieyu huan) or sterilizations (*XL, jieza)."
- "In Ili Prefecture, Nilka County's 2019 family planning policy regulations state that those who refuse to terminate illegal pregnancies or do not pay related fines are referred to the police authorities, which will “subject such persons to centralized education” (xifte # WÈ, dui xiangguan renyuan jinxing jizhong jiayu), a euphemistic shorthand for re-education internment (Nilka County, November 20, 2019). Similarly, in Qapqal County (also lli Prefecture), a government directive from January 2018 states that families with too many children who are “stubborn" and "refuse to pay fines” are subjected to “education and training" ( VII, jiaoyu peixun), again a shorthand for internment. [28] Both the timing and the contents of this directive are confirmed by the testimony of Gulnar Omirzakh, a Kazakh mother from Qapqal County. Umarzhan received a visit from the family planning office in February 2018, who slapped her with a 17,500 RMB fine and threatened her with internment if she did not pay within three days (Associated Press, June 27, 2020)."
