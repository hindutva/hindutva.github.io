    - Indonesian Hindus faced "increasing discrimination" from a rapidly Islamizing Indonesian Muslim society, including from members of "so-called moderate groups Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama," as well as from the government.\[[WL](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07JAKARTA268_a.html)\]
        - In some local districts such as Banten near Jakarta, strident Muslims had gone a step further and forced the rewriting of the local curriculum to de-emphasize Indonesia's "great Hindu past."
        - " In 2006, the Ministries of Religion and Home Affairs issued a joint decree stipulating that building a new house of worship requires a petition signed by 90 congregation members and at least 60 other community members.  The petition must then be approved by the local offices of the Religious Affairs Department and the Communications Forum for Religious Harmony (reftel)"
        - "The PHDI continued to receive accounts of Hindus unable to procure birth and marriage certificates, identity cards, and other basic local government services. Consequently, many Hindus simply identified themselves as Muslim on government identification cards to escape discrimination. Agus asserted that in recent years many Muslims in East Java, influenced by local Islamic preachers who characterized Hindus as "idol worshippers," had forced their Hindu neighbors to declare themselves Muslim."
        - PHDI leaders also claimed the plight of Hindus tended to be ignored by the government, media, and diplomats as the Hindus had no international support base. ... Kobalen said he had traveled to India and forged links with nationalist Hindu parties, but these efforts had not yet translated into financial support.

- Fiji
    - "In Fiji H mistake was family planning + not joining army during ww2, at 1 pt it was 51% Indian. Indians had a higher TFR. During ww2 Brits opened up army but these idiots demanded equal pay where as natives joined up & gained full ctrl of army. Also Indian TFR fell below Fijian " -SP17 "
    - "Prior to World War II, soldiers served voluntarily and were paid "capitation grants" according to efficiency ratings without regard to race. In 1939, during the mobilisation of the Fiji Defence Force, the British Royal Military changed its payment system to four shillings per day for enlisted men of European descent while enlisted men of non-European descent were paid only two shillings per day. Indian platoon readily disputed this disparity in pay. The British, fearing this dissidence would eventually be shared by the Native Fijians, decided to disband the Indian platoon in 1940 citing lack of available equipment, such as military armour, as their reason."
