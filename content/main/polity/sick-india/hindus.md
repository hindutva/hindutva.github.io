Where Indian politics are concerned, as a hindu, I favor ideas from the "center-right". By "right", I mean the Hindu cultural right, not the Abrahamistic right or the "anti-socialist right".  

### Problem assessment

    - [TW17](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/911092142046560256)

#### Internal to hindu-s
- Bottom-heavy human resource
    - Average IQ of 85-94. \[[TW17](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/916514822430355457)\]
        - Comparison:
            - [![](https://i.imgur.com/iyN032v.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/iyN032v.jpg)
    - "This leads to dilution of the high performers so they never cross the threshold for intensive sustained knowledge production over long periods. 2nd their efforts are ahead of their time or out of place for rest of population cannot really resonate with their innovations."
    - "The low-end might also work against the advances of the highend & can easily be exploited as cannon fodder by the enemies."
- Inadequate cultural education and successful subversion by enemies
    - Self vs non-self discrimination
- Self-imposed dumbocracy
- Excess diversity in the wrong areas i.e. areas where diversity contributes to loss rather than gain in robustness. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/05/16/some-biological-analogies-for-certain-sociopolitical-issues/)\]
    - Eg. Scripts, regionalism.
- Population and resource stress

#### External to hindu-s
- Abrahamist subversion, tending towards eventual domination, in India
    - Faster abrahamist demographic growth.
- Foreign threats: China, TSP, TSB, West.

### Desiderata: India  

Apart from [general desiderata](../../desiderata/) already mentioned, we would like the Indian state to change so that 

- Understand and counteract the severe limitations of the dumbocratic system.
- National security and Territorial integrity of the hindu homeland.
    - Not withstanding earlier fragmentation, there is greater strength in unity. The idea of what constituted the Aryavarta is quite ancient \[ See [here](../../external-affairs/id/)\].
- Efficient law enforcement.
    - Raise the number of policemen (at least) to UN recommended standards.

#### Environment protection.  
- See economics list below for mass transit etc..
- Reduce lead in water. \[[L](http://www.lead.org.au/lanv10n1/lanv10n1-5.html), [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/BcGI2HK.png)\]

#### Cultural ethos

- India should be a civilizational state, not a nation state (as expressed [here](http://www.indusresearch.org/Making-Sense-Indian-Civilizational-State.aspx)).
    - "Hinduism is to Bharat what water is to the human body: the foundation of our ancient heritage and the true source of our longevity." OGS16
    - "What we need are leaders who constantly and consistently prioritize the safety and security of Hindus without compromise." \[OGS16\]
    - A well-functioning hindu government cannot possibly not be informed/ visibly imbued by the hindu ethos (as in the case of most mahArAja-s of yore). Similar to state shinto in japAn (which is finally seeing strong revival after decades of post-war suppression), state hinduism will conspicuously hold hindu state ceremonies.
    - Israel example [here](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.628365). Burma's "protection of race and religion" laws here.

- Stop favoring non-hindu/ anti-hindu religions, and unnecessarily controlling hindu affairs.  
    - Indian government is stopped from interfering in the affairs of any specific religion, as long as it does not threaten national security. Specifically it should stop managing Hindu temples and cede their control to a body analogous to the gurdvAra-prabandhak-committee or the waqf board.
        - Karnataka has spent a mere 1/5 of the money it earned due to its management of hindu temples/ institutions for upkeep/ donation. The rest was assigned to Muslim and Christian institutions ([ES](http://www.esamskriti.com/essay-chapters/Why-must-temple-collections-be-controlled-by-the-Indian-Government-1.aspx)).
    - Various cases of double standards by Indian courts should be curbed.
        - jalli kaTTu, dahi haNDi limitations vs ashura ([TW16](https://twitter.com/SirZaidHamid/status/786456228989919233)).
    - This 2012 rioting bill with special treatment against the "majority" should be trashed.
    - The Indian government, at long last, was ordered to stop providing [haj subsidies](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Muslim-leaders-welcome-Supreme-Courts-decision-to-abolish-Haj-subsidy/articleshow/13052845.cms/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=toionFB) to muslim pilgrims.
    - Stop giving easy loans to people just because they are not Hindu-s.

- Hindu soldiers must be allowed to wear religious symbols. \[[N](http://wwrn.org/articles/13806/?&place=india&section=church-state)\]      
- Stop special treatment for religious and linguistic minorities. Scrap article 30.
- Language
    - Transition towards use of Prakrits (at state level) and Sanskrit at national level for adminitration and governance (Carl's [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/sankrant1/language-policy-for-a-new-india-v1)).  
    - Imposition of local language on migrants and consequential regionalism are a huge drain on our human resources \[[MT16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/748000183108177921)\].

#### Stopping Abrahamisms
- Generally, our Abrahamistic (mostly muslim) brothers and sisters must be provided urgent help and treatment so as to rid them of their serious and dangerous memetic epidemic (more in the [treatment page](../../../rivals/abe-disease/islam/treatment/)).

More specific steps are outlined below.
- The major defiled/ destroyed hindu temples may be legally and efficiently restored from the clutches of Islam.
    - somanAtha-shivAlaya (restored by the great sardAr vallabh bhAi paTel after 1947) and rAma-janma-bhUmI in ayodhyA (Dec 1991) are good starts.
- On muslim demographics: Relatively higher muslim population growth rate is a threat to our hindu ethos.  
- Article 370 which grants special statuses to J&K is scrapped.
    - Voiding the traty of accession is not such a big deal. If India must renegotiate it, it must strongly consider imposing it not withstanding the protests of the dominant tribes of kAshmIri muslims (as distinguished from rest of J&K population). They consider themselves an unwilling part of the union anyway; and it is not the supposed 'moral superiority' which is keeping India's control over the valley in reality.
    - Illegal immigration of Muslims from bAngladesh should be stopped.
        - Research shows that setting boundaries promotes peaceful coexistence \[[plos](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095660)\] (atleast until there's war to renegotiate the boundaries).
    - More [here](../demographics/).
- No Islamic preacher who endorses destruction of temples should be allowed into India.
    - 25k wahabi preachers from Arabia visited India between 2011 and 2014. \[[OI](http://www.oneindia.com/india/ib-vs-wahabi-the-war-against-saudi-funding-1791334.html)\]
- Muslim migrants to India must be granted citizenship - only if they convert to hindu-s.
    - Immigrants to Germany did this to claim chances of persecution if they return home \[[DA15](http://www.dawn.com/news/1204912/)\].
- Ban and punish proselytization by Abrahamic religions.

#### Economics.
- Cut the red tape - make it easier to start and run businesses.
- Develop excellent mass transit, reduce oil and lithium import. \[[SP17](https://www.facebook.com/shatruntapa/posts/1765092310192078)\]

#### International politics.
- India should aggressively pursue its national interests.
    - It should aggressively counter the intolerant anti-hindu ideology of militant Islam everywhere in the world.  
- It should vigorously defend its borders from encroachments by its neighbors. Eg: China, Pakistan.
- It should support pagans worldwide from the intolerant monotheisms and state suppression.
    

## On Hindu politics

### Desiderata

- **Worldwide Heathen revival**. \[[MT](http://indiafacts.co.in/historical-hindu-responses-abrahamism/)\] "it would be more apposite for Hindus to instead be leaders and catalysts of the heathen-world, encouraging the revival and restoration of local heathen traditions, serving more as a model, meta-template, and in some cases the “glue” rather than being transmitters of their own practice as is. Unlike the old thinkers discussed above, it is important to realize that the metaphysics of neo-vedānta or yoga are pretty useless by themselves in serving as a globalized version of the dharma. Rather the emphasis should be on rituals, which will become rites and festivals of the state at large as well as local provinces, both in India and elsewhere."
    - RSS sponsored Gatherings of Elders - [KE12](https://www.academia.edu/6999798/The_Gatherings_of_the_Elders._The_Beginnings_oa_Pagan_International).
- Necessary tactics for the future (from \[[KE](http://centreright.in/2014/08/the-modi-governments-hindu-agenda/#.U_Ndlj2x3Ua)\] article)
    - "When American conservatives were dissatisfied with the wobbly unprincipled policies of the Republicans, they formed a conservative pressure group to influence Republican policy choices or get favoured Republican politicians elected. I am of course not recommending the contents of the Trotskyite or the Tea Party’s outlook, but their political tactic of creating a channel of focused pressure may be worthy of emulation."
- **Corny hindutva as a slow watchdog**. "This leads one to the simple conclusion that even though Hindutva may appear corny to the elite it is an upwelling of the India’s true spirit- the Americans know it and are trying to stanch it. The elite has to Hinduise or be disowned by India- no two ways about this. What is missing is a proper Hindu elite and a leadership emerging from it. So all Hindus should realize that Hindutva is doing the dog’s work of guarding the pasture. Rather than spit on the watch dog the elite must learn to work along with it, and not be subverted by the US or other external forces. The elite has to complement Hindutva rather than combatting it." \[[MT3](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/11/18/hindutva-ko-fek-do/), [TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/730240043902763008)\]

### RSS

#### RSS Ideology.

- The movement’s official ideology is Deendayal Upadhyaya’s Integral Humanism, studied by all RSS members yet conspicuous by its absence from most “expert” studies, apparently because it sounds too innocent, not fitting in the gory enemy-image they were constructing. \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.be/2015/02/three-views-of-hindu-activism.html)\]
- Some distinctions from Fascism:
    - RSS’s (as opposed to the BJP’s) internal functioning honours the Leader Principle, it is gerontocratic and more inspired on native Guru worship than on the submission to  autocratic young men of action characteristic of the European interbellum.  \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.be/2015/02/three-views-of-hindu-activism.html)\]
    - He admitted the RSS’s principled opposition to what was the first priority of the fascist movements, viz. the seizing of political power (p.189) underlying this contrast is the fascists’ valuation of the state as crucial actor versus Hindu society’s self-reliance with only a limited role for the state.  \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.be/2015/02/three-views-of-hindu-activism.html)\]
    - Race thought too, in spite of the deceptive occasional appearance of the word “race” (then more general in meaning), failed to become central to Hindu nationalism; on the contrary, he notes that the central concept of Chiti (ca. Volksseele, “national soul”, p.172) logically favoured assimilation.  \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.be/2015/02/three-views-of-hindu-activism.html)\]

#### Goals

- Standardization and spread of values: यथा पुरा संन्यासिनो देशेऽखिलेऽपि धर्मव्यवस्थाप्रबन्धम् चक्रुः प्रयाणिकाः (<-- इदमसत्यम्। ब्राह्मणैः तथा कृतम्), तथा वयमद्य कुर्मः।
- Human Infrastructure for specific missions: यथा पुरा रामानन्दादिसंन्यासिभिर् महाराष्ट्रेषु हनुमन्मन्दिरसंयुक्ता मल्लशालाः प्रारब्धाः शिवराजम् उपचक्रुः, तथैव वयमपि "infrastructure"(आधार)-निर्माणं कुर्मः। 
- Seeding mission specific organizations:
    - उदाहरणानि
        - संस्कृतभारती
        - एकलविद्यालय
        - विश्वहिन्दुपरिषद् 
        - श्रमिकसङ्ग 
        - विद्यार्थिपरिषद्
        - \[vanavAsI-kalyAN-Ashram (incidentally one of those rare organizations actually run by vanvAsI-s rather than 'alien civilizers/ uplifters'), sevA-bhAratI, etc..\]. 
    - एताः संस्था अस्माभिरेव जनिताः, प्रारम्भे पोषिताः। इदानीमपि न ताः पृथक् संस्था इत्येवास्मद्भावना। अस्मान्विना नैता अभविष्यन् निति ध्वनितम्।
- \* यद्यपि समुदायस्तरे जातिस्तरे वा सङ्घटन्ते जनाः, हिन्दुत्वे न तथा सङ्घटन्ते, तत्रास्मत् सम्पर्कहेतुना "हिन्दुत्व"भावना+ऐक्यं च जागर्ति।

#### Modus operandi

- shaakhaa (branches and their meetings)
    - The expectation is that if hindu-s are to cooperate and contribute to society, they must first meet regularly in an extended family-like atmosphere - in a way replacing or supplementing the jAti-specific or joint-family relationships of yore.
    - No one will tell you what to think (other than indirectly through occasional nAra-s like 'hara hara mahAdeva'/ 'vIra shivAji') - the fundamental purpose is to give Hindu-s structured environment to meet regularly (daily or weekly) in a way which is attractive physically, spiritually and (to some extant) intellectually. It involves playing sports, doing yoga, singing songs and discussion. Of course, there is passion and devotion involved - but that simply comes from the fact that hindus have never separated the spiritual (in the sense of being in awe of nature) from mundane/ secular pursuits.
- Guru Golwalkar’s formulation of the “secret” , here on p.98: “There are only two secrets of our work – First is that there is no secret. And second is, Kabaddi.” This is a native group sport requiring organization: “So much power was generated by this kabaddi, power that saved lives, honour and wealth of lacs of people during partition (...) Did we organize conferences or publicize our views? We only played kabaddi.”

#### History of RSS:
- The RSS was founded in 1925 and its thinking has hardly evolved since then. Its “nationalism” is coloured by its genesis within an anti-colonial struggle as well as by then-popular European notions of a monolithic nation-state. It still glorifies Guru Golwalkar who died back in 1973, and has not produced any original ideologues ever since. \[[KE](http://centreright.in/2014/08/the-modi-governments-hindu-agenda/#.U_Ndlj2x3Ua)\]
- The allegation that the RSS remained aloof from the freedom movement, however, is  answered with the detail about RSS volunteers’ participation in the Quit India agitation of 1942 (p.233-239) \[[KE](http://centreright.in/2014/08/the-modi-governments-hindu-agenda/#.U_Ndlj2x3Ua)\]

#### Effectiveness of RSS:
- Protecting native traditions
    - The common volunteers often do sterling work. Thus, the Gathering of the Elders is a beautiful example of international bridge-building with other pre-Christian communities, achieved by an overseas RSS office-bearer, Prof. Yashwant Pathak. A delegation from Arunachal Pradesh testified to me how a handful of RSS men had generated self-organization and mobilization for survival to the natives against the offensive of the Christian missionaries, and thus stopped conversions. \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.be/2015/02/three-views-of-hindu-activism.html)\]
    - A well-known journalist testified how in his district of Kanyakumari, the nervousness and fear of the Hindu community due to Christian aggression evaporated once the RSS became active there.  \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.be/2015/02/three-views-of-hindu-activism.html)\]
- Protecting Indian lives
    - Older people have told me about the good work and even self-sacrifice by RSS workers to save Partition victims or to defend Srinagar airport until the Indian troops arrived. As this book documents, RSS volunteers have gone out of their way to save Sikhs during the 1984 Congress-engineered pogrom against them (p.177-179).  \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.be/2015/02/three-views-of-hindu-activism.html)\]
- Leadership problems
    - My meetings with RSS foot soldiers have mainly been positive. On the other hand, as SR Goel had observed, “the higher you go, the bigger the duffer you meet”. \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.be/2015/02/three-views-of-hindu-activism.html)\]
    - The cluelessness and inactivity on the Hindu front by the BJP ministers of the erstwhile Vajpayee and present Modi governments show the limited (or even reverse) effectiveness of the much-flaunted RSS grooming. \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.be/2015/02/three-views-of-hindu-activism.html)\]
- (Non)Reaction to slander
    - RSS comes across as an extremely slow learner, mostly taking the slander lying down and never developing a counter-strategy or acquiring the resources to turn the tables. \[[KE](http://centreright.in/2014/08/the-modi-governments-hindu-agenda/#.U_Ndlj2x3Ua)\]

### BJP.

- History
    - In 1922, the Hindu Mahasabha was created as a guardian of Hindu interests. In 1951, tainted by the murder of the Mahatma by one of its members, it was replaced by the Jan Sangh, which was never tempted to stray from its Hindutva ideology by a stint in power. \[[KE](http://centreright.in/2014/08/the-modi-governments-hindu-agenda/#.U_Ndlj2x3Ua)\]
    - Earlier history and downfall post-independence - [MT08](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/01/18/have-the-hindus-given-up/).
    - In 1977 it merged in the Janata Party, and in 1979, it was refounded as the BJP. For some years, the BJP was controlled to some extent by the RSS, which itself was ideologically unimaginative and stagnant, but at least somewhat principled. Because of its growth and its recruitment in modernized sections, however, the BJP moved ever farther out of the RSS ambit. By the time it came to power (1998), its ties to its mother organization had thinned sufficiently for taking initiatives that were unthinkable a few years earlier. \[[KE](http://centreright.in/2014/08/the-modi-governments-hindu-agenda/#.U_Ndlj2x3Ua)\]
- The BJP has grown out of the Golwalkar worldview, and in theory it swears by the “integral humanism” of Deendayal Upadhyaya (ca. 1965). Of this system, the name is the most important thing, as it amounts to a modern reformulation of the word Dharma. However, the party’s undeniable evolution, while modernizing its economic views and its PR, has mostly meant its growing away from ideology altogether.

### Military preparations

- Arms training
    - durgA-vAhinI for women.

## Foreign polities: subversion

- A strong self determined India is the natural result of Hindutva coming to power. Naturally, several foreign powers do not like this.
- A history of soviet subversion in India
    - Yuri Bezmenov [YT1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5It1zarINv0&feature=youtu.be), [YT2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gnpCqsXE8g).
        - [1:08:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5It1zarINv0&t=1h08m00s) begins to describe subversion of a nation. 15% resources on espionage, 85% on ideological subversion or psychological warfare.
        - Stage 1 demoralization: 15-20 yrs - Educate a generation of students. Programmed to think and react in a certain way. Unable to assess true information. (Soviets would eventually mostly mark these eventually-bitter idealists for eventual elimination.)
        - Stage 2 destabilization: 2-5 yrs. Economy, foreign relations, defence.
        - Stage 3: 6 weeks. crisis with violent change of power. Stage 4 normalization: Create impression that situation is under control.
- US subversion
    - Mostly follows the same pattern as described by Yuri Bezmenov [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5It1zarINv0&feature=youtu.be).
    - khalistani support.
- pAkistAn subversion
    - kAshmIr terrorism
    - khalistan support.
- saudi- salaafi subversion
- Chinese (pseudo communist) subversion

## On wrongly castigated entities.

### narendra modi

The burning of Hindu-s in godhra happened on Feb 27, and huge riots leading to the death of ~1300 Muslims and Hindus followed. This chief minister of Gujarat state, has been demonized as incompetant (at best) or the motivator (at worst) of the post-godhra riots.But there is a problem with this logic.

Gauge relative performance:

- During early years of Nehruvian rule (both before and after independece), there was death and mayhem before which the Gujarat riots would pale in comparison. If "1000 people died, so modi is incompetent to govern" is true, will your reasoning lead you to conclude that Nehru (and Rajiv Gandhi, and those that govern naxal infested states like Orissa) was even more incompetent to govern than Modi? If not, why not?
    - The anti-sikh riots of 1984 must be remembered.  
        

narendra moDi is an [able](http://www.ibtl.in/news/national/1502/e-governance----the-gem-behind-gujarat-s-exponential-progress---modi) and dedicated administrator, and I think that most people would have performed worse (including me and perhaps you), were they in his position. He will do [much better](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=149888291772849) in the future. Also [read this](http://www.brookings.edu/up-front/posts/2012/03/16-modi-antholis): “I was just installed in my position the day before.” He had been formally elected and sworn in on February 26th, having been acting Chief Minister for six months, mostly overseeing response to Gujarat’s 2001 earthquake.". 

### On RSS

If you can ever make the time, do attend an RSS (or HSS in america) shAkhA - you may well be even more surprised by this "Hindu outfit" which has persistently been demonized in the media \[I speak from experience\]. Any one who is willing to call himself a hindu is welcome, as long as he is so undisciplined and prone to violence that he would fit VHP or bajaranga-dala better.

## Threat of Regionalist identities

- Regional rivalries can often be exploited by enemies of Hindus. Claiming to address genuine or imagined grievances, they can weaken the Hindu state. Example: "Dravidian" faultine and the Anglospheric interventions.
- Some prominent rivalries
    - tamiL nADu vs karNAtaka regarding the kAverI \[[2016 analysis](https://twitter.com/ainvvy/status/775687445719298048) \- stupid supreme court decision\]

## Racinomisia (= hatred of one's cultural roots)

#### Of the abrahamists

- See [here](../../../rivals/abe-disease/islam/intro/).

#### Of the Indian left

Yogindar Sikand's piece typifies the racinomisia-filled attitude of the "[Indian Left](http://www.countercurrents.org/sikand190412.htm)".

The mechanism and effects of this influence has been explored in detail in ["Breaking India: Western Interventions in Dravidian and Dalit Faultlines"](http://www.breakingindia.com/) by Rajiv Malhotra and Aravindan Neelakandan.

## Forecast

To quote Vikram: "Hunger is widespread and pervasive in India, but affects only about 20 % of the population (and this proportion has been declining continuously). Also, India is the largest newspaper reading country in the world. The literacy rate is almost 75 % and steadily increasing. All trends indicate that the people who can make good decisions (w.r.t. food and education) are the majority, and are forming a larger and larger proportion of the population with time."

### Investigations

On the anticipated fraction of Abrahamists in India.

- How to file an RTI?
    - [onlinerti.com](http://onlinerti.com/) ( Looks like only Indian credit cards work there though.)
    - Prior RTI-s
        - Muzrai department and Waqf board - incomes vs expenditure. (??)

### Involvement

- Mygov [forum](http://mygov.nic.in/group_info/bangalore-urban). (can't start new discussion topics.)
- PMO [message](http://pmindia.gov.in/en/interact-with-honble-pm/).

## Kashmir \[2012\]

These Urdu Pakistani TV interviews with Pakistani journalist Najam Sethi summarizes my understanding of the situation (both the past and the present): [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwDFdevnyE) and [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye3NC0w4agQ). kAshmIri muslims seem to want freedom from India, while not joining Pakistan either. Terror spurt: ([India Today 1990](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/terrorism-takes-a-perilous-turn-in-kashmir/1/315063.html)). 

### About the kAshmIri paNDit-s

It pains me that the descendents of abhinavagupta, kalhaNa, bilhaNa, kShemendra, kShemarAja, kayyaTa, bhallaTa, rudraTa etc.. should become such dunces that they are dominated by the likes of motilAl and "paNDit" javAharlAl, and that they should then loose their valley in such sorry fashion.

kashmIri paNDit-s were quite scholarly at the turn of the 20th century (Aurel Stein's collaborators [here](http://www.siraurelstein.org.uk/native.html)). Later, however, traitors and idiots reared their heads with motilaal and javAharlaal. This continues today.  

Of course, being an Hindu, I do not want to let the land of abhinavagupta and kashyapa to relapse into Islamic rule. The ethnic cleansing of the hindu Kashmiri paNDit community is a sad event, it was preceded by a proliferation of madarasa-s. As detailed elsewhere on this page, I would like Article 370 repealed, that kAshmIri paNDits and any hindu-s willing to live there be resettled in kAshmIr with dignity.
