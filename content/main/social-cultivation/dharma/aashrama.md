## Intro

An individual's life passes through various phases. Important among them were described and suggested by dharma-shAstra writers with the view of bringing and maintaining individual and social harmony. Phase transitions were especially marked. Following are the four major stages of life: 

  

- brahmacharya - Student life, starting with upanayana and ending with samAvartana.
    - naiShThika-brahmacharya, starting with a special ceremony after samAvartana.
- gRhastha - Householder life, starting with vivAha/ marriage. The most important Ashrama, for this is where family traditions are maintained. 
    - brahmachArin-s taking up sannyAsa or vAnaprastha without marriage is criticized.
        - Eg. indra in MBh - "ke cid gṛhān parityajya vanam abhyagaman dvijāḥ/ ajātaśmaśravo mandāḥ kule jātāḥ pravavrajuḥ/ etc.." \[[GA16](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/756753649888481281)\]
    - Mate choice and marriage maintenance - [KV18](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2018/04/08/marriage-advice-for-hindu-snataka-s/).
    - "Hindu parents rooted in Dharma are living temples." \[OGS\]
- vAnaprastha - Retirement to forest. (vaikhAnasa-gRhya-sUtra gives a procedure for transition to this Ashrama, while others don't.)
- sannyAsa - Asceticism in pursuit of mokSha or Ananda (../described [here](../tattvam/purushaartha/)), mostly to the neglect of pravRtti-dharma.
    - Not at all dealt with by the gRhya-sUtra-s - some say because it is out of scope, others say that this is because this Ashrama was unknown, unpopular or frowned upon.
    - Early mention in the bRhadAraNyaka. An easy extension of the naiShThika-brahmachArI concept. Possibly later gained more and more acceptance due to the influential shramaNa streams.
    - Rejected by several later texts as kali-varjya.
    - The controversial role of Ananda-pursuit in the neglect of dharma by hindu-s is considered [here](../../tattvam/purushaartha/).

## gRhasthAshrama

- Main purpose

- Child marriage.
    - shatAvadhAnI gaNesh's view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXustFOkOr4&feature=em-uploademail).
    - Child marriage is referred to in the distant past, but very rarely.
    - Consummation ritual ought to happen on the fourth day of marriage - this indicates that adult marriage was intended. But later practice changed this and introduced a delay. \[[TW17](https://twitter.com/agnimaan/status/849856736110362624)\]
    - Common ages of marriage, classically, were: 20 for men (having completed 12 years of education starting at 8) and about 16 for women.
    - Note: It should not be considered inferior to adult marriage out of hand.
- Inbreeding
    - prohibited by manu
    - Prevelant (in the past and an few pockets now) in south india (eg among shrautins: [IMG](https://imgur.com/9mKPIOJ)).
- Widow remarriage / status.
    - UN report about widows left in vArANAsi : [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SxPv5aQP0c).
    - shatAvadhAnI gaNesh's view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXustFOkOr4&feature=em-uploademail) paints a sympathetic picture of such women before 1k years.
    - sati / jIvahara/ jowhar : Ritual suicide of widows (usually at the husband's funeral pyre).
        - "As per numerous testimonies, most self-immolating widows went into the pyre voluntarily, often overcoming pressure from their relatives or from the authorities not to do it."
        - "It was confined to the real or would-be warrior castes, though, in keeping with their ethos of pride and passion."
        - "For Brahmins it was forbidden, a negative judgment going back to this Rg-Vedic verse. ... It is only logical that some rulers in the Brahmin-dominated Maratha confederacy forbid the practice even before the British East India Company Governor Lord William Bentinck (under prodding from Hindu reformer Ram Mohan Roy) abolished it by law in 1829."

- Divorce
    - There is an ancient sanskrit word for divorce - a beautiful and very meaningful word. kauTilya uses it - mokSha. It is a simple misconception that there is no provision for divorce among hindu thinkers. \[[A1](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marriage/comprehensive-essay-on-divorce-in-india/4370/)\]
