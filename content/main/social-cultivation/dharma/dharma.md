## What is dharma?

One can think of dharma as a collection of role-appropriate codes of good behavior which benefits other beings (fellow members of the society, animals, the plants, the spirits ...). The dharma has very powerful motivations and theory behind it (explained later in this page). They may be explicitly codified or they may be informal.

For the purpose of this article, dharma is NOT the following directly:

- A collection of teachings.
    - (As in the buddhist saying "dhammam sharaNam gachChAmi")
- The essential nature of an object (Though that sense is an inappropriate generalization).
- Rituals only (being narrower than the intended meaning here).

Emergence of hindu thoughts on dharma:

- The ancient Hindu obsession with the concept of dharma is huge. There is a mountain of dharmashAstra works.
    - For a more thorough treatment, please see History of the Dharmashastras - P V Kane (links [here](https://sites.google.com/site/samskrtamsfo/prayogah/dharmasastram)).
- Sources of the dharma include the veda-s, itihAsa-s, purANa-s, the vedAnga called kalpa (which includes dharmasUtra-s, smRtis, dharmashAstra-s and their commentaries).
    - General intro to valid sources of hindu knowledge [here](../../bases/books/index/).
    - These sources are classifified into shruti (veda-s), smRti texts and shiShTAchAra (practice of learned elders).
        - All of these are ultimately said to derive from the veda-s in some traditions - hypothesizing lost veda-s and brAhmaNa-s in the process.
    - Among the smRti-s
        - manu-smRti and yAJNavalkya-smRti were the most important classically (going by the number of commentaries).
        - parAshara-smRti is considered by itself (the beginning verses) and many (eg. vidyAraNya and P V Kane) as the most suitable for the kali age, due to its flexibility. Especially because it lacks a vyavahAra section. \[[UPSC05](https://books.google.com/books?id=yWfeU9eQd5YC&pg=SL1-PA174&lpg=SL1-PA174&dq=AchAra+vyavahara+prayashcitta&source=bl&ots=MJQb21hyU_&sig=n62rTw_gHZlfPijo38k9r6YJECU&hl=sa&sa=X&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMI-4vps6XnxgIVCqOICh2W_QXx#v=onepage&q=AchAra%20vyavahara%20prayashcitta&f=false)[IM](http://i.imgur.com/2pcqltY.png)\] From its recommendations regarding kShatriya-s, for example, one can allow for the existence of kShatriya-s even in the kali age.
    - From a shaaastric view, all shaakhaas and all smRtis are authoritative to all (Mimaamsaa: SaakhaantaraadhikaraNam) with some rules for conflict resolution.
        - Primacy of veda-s relative to other shAstra-s - see holy books page [here](../../bases/books/index/).
    - Sectarian dharmottara-s aim to faithfully summarize the dharma prescribed in the other sources.
        - shivadharmottara - "पुराणं भारतं वेदाः शास्त्राणि सुमहान्ति च/ आयुषः क्षपनायैव धर्मो ऽल्पग्रन्थसंस्थितः॥"
    - Random anubhava is not traditionally considered a source of dharma. It has to be established by tarka based on texts (led by veda-s) and shiShTAchAra practices of elders.
        - For example: "न धर्मजिज्ञासायामिव श्रुत्यादय एव प्रमाणं ब्रह्मजिज्ञासायाम् । किन्तु श्रुत्यादयोऽनुभवादयश्च यथासम्भवमिह प्रमाणम्, अनुभवावसानत्वाद्भूतवस्तुविषयत्वाच्च ब्रह्मज्ञानस्य ।" (shankara in brahmasUtrabhAShyam 1.1.2).

##  Survival, thriving and competitive advantage

- From the point of view of nature, in the context of competing cultural memes, the ultimate value of dharma memeplex is the fitness benefit it provides to the society.
    - In all likelihood, as the wise have noted ([20151212](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/a-note-on-the-early-expansions-of-the-indo-europeans/)), it was this memeplex (esp: notion of dharma, shAstra-s and a strong brahma-kShatra social system) that was instrumental in its votaries sweeping away and dominating all resistance across vast swathes of geography and time; while assimilating and adapting new entrants and peripheral practices of other pagans.
        - "It is for this system our Indo-Aryan ancestors had the words like ṛta and dharma. Even in far off Bali in the East, even after many, many genetic admixtures, this system, which had developed in steppe-land, held fast in those who were soaked in it. But today practitioners of most branches of this ancient system of thought have ceased to be such – they only have the languages not the system. The Iranians have been reduced to a tribe and are on route to extinction – we are to only ones who remain and some among us still understand its essence in form not far from what it was on bronze age steppes despite all its evolution over the millennia. Beyond religion in the narrow sense, in its orthodox and heterodox forms, this system is at the foundation of everything else notable across the branches of the Indo-European world like science, technology, and arts." (MT[20151212](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/a-note-on-the-early-expansions-of-the-indo-europeans/))
            - An example of the depth of artistic influence in South East asia : \[[Muj](https://twitter.com/ColonelGerard/status/504770071411961856)\].
        - "The modern H religion or for that matter even the Indian phase of the vaidika form of the religion show flavors that might've originated from proto-Indian traditions. For.eg. use of coconut with mango leaves, & the transfer of old IE tree veneration to subcontinental figs might be substral influence. Yet, the core structure of the Hindu religion in its vedic & later manifestations, caste or tribal/avarNa is very recognizably IE than anything else.This's true of other branches of IE settling elsewhere too. .. My current conclusion is that the IE religion was imminently adaptable to any local situation far from any home geography or base racial group because of its mobile steppe origins: A place where a city-like locus means little compared to the west Asian city based cults & categories in the world view& ritual've a certain degree of generality that any1 in the heathen world can identify with. Not to forget earliest potential IE people as we know them were genetically composite." \[[MTTW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/739516248522915840)\]
    - However, dangerous threats have emerged (see "modern context" below.)  
        
- That this was an important motivation for holding to dharma is apparent from highly regarded sayings such as : "धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः" "धर्मो धारयते प्रजाः"।

## Other motivations and essential spirit

- Below, we consider the essence of the dharmashAstra, rather than the details, in our quest to gather the noble spirit of the shAstra.
- Specific beliefs and motivations are nowhere as important as compliance - this naturally allows diversity of beliefs. For example, kRShNa encouraging arjuna in bhagavadgItA : अव्यक्तोऽयमचिन्त्योऽयमविकार्योऽयमुच्यते। तस्मादेवं विदित्वैनं नानुशोचितुमर्हसि।।2.25अथ चैनं नित्यजातं नित्यं वा मन्यसे मृतम्। तथापि त्वं महाबाहो नैवं शोचितुमर्हसि।।2.26।।
- All this admirable thinking about the dharma partly emerged out of an urge to emerge out of chaos, harmonize social roles and rituals of various groups of people; so as to achieve a happy and fit society. Aesthetic refinement in our social behavior (which includes AchAra and saMskAra) is one component of achieving it. \[PV Kane [here](http://i.imgur.com/ZNlBV7N.png).\]
- It also addresses the very real fact that most people cannot be truly, lastingly happy if they do not do something for the happiness of others -because:
    - innate conscience
        - The golden rule and a desire to do good. \[[FB15](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153135619327989&set=a.10151672801737989.1073741826.689472988&type=1&permPage=1)\]
        - प्रमाणम्
            - विद्वद्भिः सेवितः सद्भिर्नित्यं अद्वेषरागिभिः । **हृदयेनाभ्यनुज्ञातो** यो धर्मस्तं निबोधत॥ २.१ इति मनुः।
            - वेदोऽखिलो धर्ममूलं स्मृतिशीले च तद्विदाम् । आचारश्चैव साधूना**मात्मस्तुष्टिरे**व च ॥  इति मनुः।
        - **The law of karma**: This innate conscience was strengthened and formalized by the theory of karma (which involves supernatural beliefs about reward and punishment). Parts of the dharmashAstra, called karmavipAka, deal with associating misfortunes in this life with bad deeds in past lives.
        - **RNa** \- gratitude or indebtedness and **Rta**.
            - We feel indebted to nature, the deva-s, our parents, teachers, society etc.. This feeling of indebtedness and the need to sustain the systems that nurtured us was formalized in terms of RNa-s. RNa-s can only fulfilled by dharma.
            - "जायमानो वै ब्राह्मणस्त्रिभिः ऋणवा जायते ब्रह्मचर्येण ऋषिभ्यो यज्ञेन देवेभ्यः प्रजया पितृभ्यः । एष वा अनृणो यः पुत्री यज्वा ब्रह्मचारी वा" इति तैत्तिरीयसंहितायाम्।
            - This acknowledgement of indebtedness is in turn based on the concept of **Rta** (../divine order in the universe), through which interconnectedness of various beings is known and felt. (More [here](../tattvam/Rta/).)
                - So, there is a very pleasant feeling of rising above the self (I, me, my ...) to a higher (social, even cosmic) level of thinking.  
                    
        - Expositions: shatAvadhAnI gaNesha [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coghS3GbJM8).
    - Social costs and benefits
        - This includes the fact that people made unhappy by our happiness end up wrecking our happiness or at least being indifferent to it.
    - Supporting quotes:
        - सुखार्थाः सर्वभूतानां मताः सर्वाः प्रवृत्तयः । सुखं च न विना धर्मात् तस्माद्धर्मपरो भवेत् ।। \- अष्टाङ्गहृदयम्, वाग्भटः।
- **Emphasis Duties, rather than rights**.
    - The hindu-s have classically focused on duties (motivated by dharma), far more than "rights" (for which the word adhikAra, meaning eligibility, is used by modern people.)
        - "Any “right” must have a preexisting positive or negative duty on part of the other party." So, they exist - but the emphasis is on another party.
    - This emphasis on rights vs duties is very important, since it results in a difference between whether the emphasis is on:
        - oneself
        - or on the divine natural order of things (Rta), society, and one's role in it.
    - An emphasis on dharma, rather than rights, results in far greater general happiness and social harmony. The latter yields more easily to confrontation and inimical fragmentation.
    - Analogy:
        - The system of framing a person's role in society (duties vs rights) makes as much difference in its functioning as the representation of numbers does in calculation (hindu place-value number system vs roman/ egyption/ babylonian systems).
    - This is a fundamental difference of worldview between hindu and western civilizations.
        - Our ancestors wrote mountains of dharmashAstra-s, not the Magna Carta or the Bill of Rights.
    - It was a grave travesty and disaster that the Indian constitution (../1950-) emphasized more on rights than duties. Example of how things should have gone instead is shown [here](dharma-fluid/).
- Citizen building >>> material "achievements" like infrastructure building/ wealth accumulation. This was an ideal the dharmashAstra writers strove for, with their great emphasis on AchAra and prAyashcitta.
    - If our countrymen put dharma (and its motivators such as compassion and aesthics) above money and things, we would be much stronger and happier. \[[FB](https://www.facebook.com/vishvas.vasuki/posts/10153140181607989)\]
- Focus on or shifting the frame to self-enforcement. prAyashcitta (voluntary expiation) >>> daNDa (punishment), resulting in less friction and strife. 
    - As the sage Nassim Nicholas Taleb has said, a mere verbal apology should not count, since it does not really stop recidivism. There should be "skin in the game". Given that such is the case, the prAyashcitta frame is extremely valuable.
    - dharma is partly self-enforced (via AchAra, some vyavahAra and prAyashchitta), partly community enforced (via insistence on prAyashchitta) and partly state-enforced (via daNDa).
    - Example from a household: "Whenever one of us violates something we agree is the dharma (getting angry, neglecting to do something important, avoiding alien tongues etc.. ) an appropriate prAyashcitta is demanded (eg. a japa of “मन्युरकार्षीत्”, cleaning the house ) — and volunturily performed. This has increased conformance to relatively high standards of the dharma (as negotiated and agreed upon) with \*\*far\*\* less friction, compared to earlier attempts at relying on daNDa."\[[WP](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/07/29/prayashcitta-vs-danda-in-my-experience-dharmashastra-in-practice/)\]
    - Contrast with externally enforced law.
        - Law codified by the state is but one small prescriptive aspect of dharma (called daNDa).
        - Law is inadequate, and self-enforcement is needed for a healthy society. Hence, the latter should be emphasized more.
            - Consider the difference between [New Orleans looting in the wake](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9131493/ns/us_news-katrina_the_long_road_back/t/looters-take-advantage-new-orleans-mess/) of Hurricane Katrina and  Japanese citizens [voluntarily turning in money](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/22/world/la-fg-japan-returned-money-20110923) after the Tsunami.
            - Consider the difference between the American reliance on laws and the Japanese reliance on [customs as experienced](http://www.amerika.org/politics/shiba-ryotaro-meets-the-gays/) by Shiba Ryotaro.
                - "Japan, France, Korea, Denmark were not created out of laws, but rather began as organizations of people, and modern laws simply reordered those organizations. America is the opposite. The law cast its net over a broad \[empty\] territory, and eventually immigrants arrived and pledged themselves to those laws, so that the country is nothing more than the sum of its laws. ... America is a country with only a civilization. Can someone coming from a country full of culture (customs) even imagine that? People like me, who live surrounded by culture (customs), have no need to write it down as laws. ... In the case of Japan, most people go through life without ever needing the services of a civil lawyer. But America is the country with the most lawyers in the world.
- A memeplex that places emphasis in the following order: scholarship in sacred lore (brAhmaNa-s) >> governance and defence (kShatriya-s) >> commerce (vaiShya-s) >> service (shUdra-s).
    - This orients a society to hold sacredness and spirituality above mere material achievements.
- Harmonization of social groups
    - The system of four varNa-s (../mostly determined by birth), with their varying duties, was used to harmonize society (more [here](../social-cultivation/clan/varna-theory/)). Keeping in mind relatively deeper principles of the dharma and changed circumstances, this part of the essential spirit may now be abandoned in favor of other systems.

### Types of dharma

Many are the roles in society, and accordingly the Hindu thought-stream has produced many such codes of behavior, which broadly fall into two categories:

-  pravRtti-dharma (dharma that benefits other beings) 
- nivRtti-dharma (../dharma that withdraws from pravRtti-dharma-s, seeking ultimate liberation or mokSha). This is considered [elsewhere](../tattvam/purushaartha/).

pravRtti-dharma is traditionally of many kinds :

- sAdhAraNa-dharma, which is common to all beings.
- visheSha-dharma, which is context-specific.
    - guNa-dharma - professional/ social role specific. Eg. the dharma of the father, the dharma of the mother, the dharma of a son, the dharma of a king (../irrespective of whether he is a kShatriya), the dharma of an engineer etc.. rAja-dharma or the government's dharma is particularly important. See examples [here](../social-cultivation/clan/varna-theory/).
    - varNa-dharma - Social community specific. Eg. brAhmaNa-dharma, kShatriya-dharma etc.. More [here](../../social-cultivation/clan/varna-theory/).
    - Ashrama-dharma - stage-of-life-dharma. brahmachAri-dharma, gRhastha-dharma, vAnaprastha-dharma, saMnyAsa-dharma
        - Combined with varNa-dharma, this becomes varNAshrama-dharma.
    - naimittika-dharma - Circumstancial dhrama. Eg. prAyashchitta for sins.
        - Apat-dharma - dharma in emergency and extraordinary situations.
            -  ChAndogya upaniShad where a Brahmin begged for ucchisTha beans from a person of a lower varna which was justified as there was scarcity of grain/beans...but he rejected the ucchisTha water offered by the same person as unlawful since there was no scarcity of water.

## Form

- Many smRti-s divided their recommendations into three parts. AchAra, vyavahAra and prAyashcitta. \[[UPSC05](https://books.google.com/books?id=yWfeU9eQd5YC&pg=SL1-PA174&lpg=SL1-PA174&dq=AchAra+vyavahara+prayashcitta&source=bl&ots=MJQb21hyU_&sig=n62rTw_gHZlfPijo38k9r6YJECU&hl=sa&sa=X&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMI-4vps6XnxgIVCqOICh2W_QXx#v=onepage&q=AchAra%20vyavahara%20prayashcitta&f=false)[IM](http://i.imgur.com/2pcqltY.png)\]
- Right behavior (**AchAra**)
    - (saMskAra) - Rites of passage that "prepare" a certain entity (individual or the womb etc..) for some function.
- Socially approved and genuine repentance of mistakes (**prAyashchitta**)
- Dealings (**vyavahAra**) - Conventions governing interactions amongst multiple people. Eg: Disputes, property inheritence, trails etc..
- **yajJNa** \- Sacrifice in exchange of gain received, sharing. This is a fundamental concept in AchAra and vyavahAra.
    - Each of the debts (**RNa**-s) are fulfilled using a corresponding (a daily and seasonal) sacrifice. This includes:
        
        - Sacrifice for deities (daiva-yaJNa) by oblations, humans (mAnuSha-yaJNa) by donating food and wealth, sages and teachers (ARSha-yaJNa) by preserving and propagating knowledge, environment (bhUta-yaJNa) by planting trees and feeding animals.
        
    - Important components of yajjna are faith in the nobility of the act ( shraddhA ), dAna (which is sAttvika if done without expectation of return favors from that source).
    - These can be split into two sub-forms:
        - iShTi - vaidika yAga-s relevant to only initiated dvija-s
        - pUrti
            - Construction of public utilities (wells, agrahAra-s to house the Arya-conservativist brAhmaNa class, schools, temples, dharmashAlA-s ...)
            - Contributing food and grains 
                - Offering food to guests and strangers - even to chaNDAla-s (part of the daily vaishvadeva rite for brAhmaNa-s)
                    - An important form is offering food to brahmachArins and students. A varient was in wide practice in karNATaka (vAradanna) and Andhra (vArAlu) as the weekday's meal system. ("Vedic voices" book)

## Compromising lower ideals for higher ideals

- To achieve a higher good (and never for mere personal gain), one may need to sacrifice lower ideals. For example:
    - One may need to behave dishonorably towards a dishonorable enemy. So, means and ends are intertwined.
    - See kauShitaki "knowing indra" text and other ideas under "subjugation to the "ultimate reality"" [here](../../bases/books/index/).
    - Personal loyalties and friendships should not supersede one's notion of what's right and proper. This is what sItAparityAga and verses such as "द्वेष्योऽपि संमतः शिष्टस्तस्यार्तस्य यथौषधम् । त्याज्यो दुष्टः प्रियोऽप्यासीदङ्गुलीवोरगक्षता" tell us.  
    - "For the sake of dharma, for the sake of the larger good, for the sake of lasting welfare, one has to adopt some unfair practices and use some immoral methods. But one who undertakes this must _necessarily be selfless and intelligent_. This is the path shown by Krishna in the Mahabharata." says shrI gaNesha.
- The need to overcome populism and vain show-off:
    - One drawback we hindus had was misplaced generocity - a paucity of ruthlessness. The source is nothing but moral weakness and fragility. These people want approval and admiration of others. This is the disease that motivated moronic actions right from dharmarAja to (supposedly) PrithvirAja Chauhan to Nehru and Gandhi. Think what kind of disaster it would have been if kRShNa thought that way. Alas! this consciousness found in bhIma and kRShNa turned out to be so rare!
- Supporting events
    - That yudhiShThira gave duryodhana his choice of weapon and combatant when he emerged from the lake hiding spot, and kRShNa scolded him - "Again, even now you are gambling! A deceitful person should be destroyed with deceit without this kind of show."
- Supporting sayings
    - bhIma to yudhiShThira - "धर्मलेशप्रतिच्छन्नः प्रभवं धर्मकामयोः। अर्थमुत्सृज्य किं राजन् दुःखेन परितप्यसे ॥ ... एवमेव मनुष्येन्द्र धर्मं त्यक्त्वाऽल्पकं नरः। बृहन्तं धर्ममाप्नोति बुधानामेष निश्चयः॥".
    - शठं प्रति शाठ्यम्।
    - दाक्षिण्यं स्वजने दया परिजने **शाठ्यं सदा दुर्जने** प्रीतिस्साधुजने नयो नृपजने विद्वज्जनेष्वार्जवम् । शौर्यं शत्रुजने क्षमा गुरुजने कान्ताजनॆ धृष्टता ये चैवं पुरुषाः कलासु कुशलाः तेष्वेव लोकस्थितिः ॥ \- नीतिशतकम्

## Modern context

- The motivations described earlier still drive us today, and we must do our best to imbibe the spirit (not the letter) of the classical dharmashAstra thought and refine ourselves as individuals and communities.
- Hindu culture and civilization is facing an existential threat.
    - "But it has a dangerous rival – a memetic complex of a pathogenic type that arose in the Afro-Asiatic milieu of West Asia. This rival is the one which has extinguished the system across the former IE world and taken up the riches generated by the IE system as its “secular” property. Branches of this rival system are now baying for the blood of the last great bulwark of the old IE system." (MT[20151212](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/a-note-on-the-early-expansions-of-the-indo-europeans/))
- **आत्मविस्मृतिः** \- Our society (or a large part of it) has slipped away from dharma.  
    - क्षात्रे धर्मभ्रंशः (म्लेच्छशासनम्,भूहरणम्, आङ्ग्लपूरणम्, मूर्खप्रजाप्रभुत्वम्, अतिशयारक्षणम्, सद्ब्राह्मणासमर्थनम्) → दारिद्र्यम् (विशिष्य भारतीयसंस्कृतेर् अध्येतृषु), लोभोऽपि कश्चित् → विक्रयणम् → आत्मविस्मृतिर् व्यापिनी → जुगुप्सा क्वचित् → कामेनार्थेन च साकम् भारतीय-सत्त्वस्य रक्षणम् तैः। \[[KV16](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2016/04/25/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE/)\]
    - Abandonment of much of the dharma memeplex in favor of a west-aping constitution in India has happened.
        - Ambedkar claimed that his constitution took the best from the dharmashAstra-s; but this is not so. That guy did not have any deep scholarship in the dharmashAstra-s (maybe just enough to denounce them). It's more like he copy-pasted from non dharma-shAstra sources ("The Constitution borrowed largely from the Government of India Act, under which India was governed and which was the basis of transfer of power, and from the American, Australian, and Irish constitutions.").
            - I think that bhImrAv was a fighter guy, whose revulsion flooded out whatever little compassion he could muster for the authors of the dharmashAstra; so that in the end he did not understand their motives well at all (either for want of desire or effort) .
        - PV kANe points out several problems with it in his last volume. The most tragic of it, in my view, is the fundamental shift from duties to rights. If only he had the depth of understanding that the duty-frame used in the dharmashAstra-s are superior!
    - In many ways, our civilization is in a state of senescence (../method of analysis of history [here](../history/intro/)).
- Other adjustments
    - Flaws in older thought
        - In classical dharmashAstra work, a major flaw was an excessive focus on ritual, hair-splitting arguments, unnecessary subdivisions.
            - Perhaps that arose from the need to encode and ratify contemporary informal conventions.
    - Many of the specific recommendations of the dharmashAstra literature are no longer applicable in this modern age because our context is different in terms of:
        - multi-culturalism,
        - technology
        - locus within societies that have deviated too far from the classical patterns.

## Parallels elsewhere

- maat of the Egyptians
- "Just as dharma has the divine dimension of the laws laid down by the great gods Mitra and Varuṇa (captured in the śruti) at the base of the yasag was the old “divine law” of the Turks and Mongols known as the törü which is said to have been promulgated by the god Köke Möngke Tengri. On this rested the yasag of the great Khan which was like the smṛti brought to humans by Yama and our law-giver father Manu.  Among the Mongols it seems to have inspired later reforms of law like the “Code of Altan Khan” promulgated by Altan Khan in the 1500s. ... shaikh against the Mogol tyrant Akbar’s wishes we see him increasingly remodeling his law as per the yasag of Chingiz Khan and moving away from the sharia." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\]
