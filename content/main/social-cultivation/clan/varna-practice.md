title: varNa practice
---
   

  

## Introduction

- **Correspondence of theory with practice**
    - Frameworks always exist and make sense once defined - irrespective of how closely they were practiced. Whether or not one writes in the hindu decimal system, it exists. What matters to us (and the creators of the many many dharmashAstra works) is - how useful is the framework in \*organizing\* or systematizing the society to make it function smoothly.
- **The stable brAhmaNa core**
    - The brAhmaNa-s conserved their original ethnicity to a higher degree than the kShatriya-s and others. This stability did not hinder the spread of vaidika ideals throughout initially non-vaidika populations in the early times.  
        
    - Indeed, some dharmashAstra-s get along fine assuming that in the kaliyuga there are only brAhmaNa-s and shUdra-s - the kShatriya-s having disappeared after the nanda takeover, and vaishya-s having given up their AchAra; while others disagree. All this, really, is beside the point. The varNa system was still the framework used to organize the society and settle disputes.
- **Overlay of varNa-s on jAti-s**: varNa-s were overlaid on/ mapped to many many pre-existing jAti-s (which could vary). These jAti-s and sub-jAti-s had their own hierarchies and restrictions on marriage and inter-dining beyond what the varNa-system required.
    - These myriad jAti-s were hypothesized to have arisen from the main varNa-s mixing together in various ways.
    - brAhmaNa-s learned in the dharmashAstra-s adjudicated disputes regarding varNa-assignment.
        - "On matters of dharma, including varNa and jāti, non-specialist administrative and legal functionaries of regional courts, lacking in Sanskrit knowledge, deferred to specialist Brahmins living in places like Paithan and later Banaras. Dalmia describes Banaras as a “supraregionally recognized” locus of juridical authority (Dalmia 1996: 322–3). The brahmasabhā would issue a decision, recorded in a document called a vyavasthā-patra (‘document (patra) bearing the decision (vyavasthā)’) or vijaya-patra (‘document spelling out the victory (vijaya) (of the authoritative claim"(siddhānta)’).169 The disputants would carry out the injunctions of this document, and their local political authority would not object." \[[AV2011](http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1088&context=ananya_vajpeyi)\]
- **Education and jAti**
    - see background [here](../intellect-sentiment/).
    - In south India, shUdra courtezans like madhuravANI were highly learned in the shAstra-s and accomplished poets. ([SG1](https://youtu.be/xUdrbAZJCEk?t=275), [SG2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff6mVQ_yn2s) ). Same with devadAsI-s.
        - "Sri Narayana Guru discusses how his Ezhava ancestors studied and authored medical texts in Sanskrit. Likewise, Balasaraswathi recounts that even 400 years ago, her ancestors from the Isai Vellaala caste (an MBC caste) authored treatises in music in Sanskrit and Tamil."  
            
    - An account of education in early 1800-s in Bengal - [GB](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FZcxAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA714).
    - shUdra women (albeit princesses) did have excellent access to sanskrit. (eg. mallamma linked below).
    - [Beuatiful tree](http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/beautifultree.pdf) pg 311: "The Vaidyas or medical tribe, and even some rich Kayasthas, are permitted to study such portions of Sanskrit literature as have been composed by wise men; but they are excluded from whatever is supposed to be of divine origin and authority. ".  
        
- **Sentimental life, rituals and Ananda pursuit** :
    - This closely followed the theory described [here](../varna-theory/) (search term: Ananda).
    - In some cases, brAhmaNa-s accepted non-brAhmaNa saints as honored gurus.
        - There are cases like a shrIvaiShNava brAhmaNa carrying a dalit on his shoulders so that he could visit the deva without violating temple rules, falling at their feet, insisting on eating food leftover after serving them ( [rAmAnuja](http://www.iskcontimes.com/archive/ramanuja-chides-his-wife) ).
        - madhusUdana-sarasvatI initiated many sannyAsins from other dvija-varNa-s with the intention of protecting brAhmaNa sannyAsins as suggested by bIrbal \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/WLSY6VL.jpg)\].
        - matsyendranAtha's 1k year old tradition initiates non-brAhmaNa sannyAsins as well.  
            
- **jAti position relative to mlecCha-s**
    - mlecCha-s were in practice treated better than the lowest strata of the native society. This made sense since they brought with them military and economic power which hindus wanted to deal with, and since they were located outside India.
    - This proved mal-adaptive when the mlecCha-s started living and breeding in the Arya lands. For example: A low-jAti person converted to a muslim or christian would be treated much better. This contributed to their increase in numbers. (../More [here](future/).)

## Rigidity vs fluidity

Hindu legal/ behavioral/ social system is not at all static. \[See [here](../../dharma-fluid/).\] It has adjusted to the abolition of jAti-privileges relatively smoothly.

- Factors in favor of rigidity: Self interest, Standards etc.. are considered in the Motivation section in the theory-page.
- Social fluidity in the far ancient times is considered [here](../india-entry/).
- Non examples

### Early overall ossification of jAti hierarchies and differences.

- varNa classification was ancient and predated Arya entry into India. More notes in the [Aryan entry page](../india-entry/).
- By the time Megasthenes visited, there were already rigid restrictions about intermarriage and avocations. \[[MI](http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/upload/Megasthene-Indika.pdf)\]
    - " Such, then, are about the parts into which the body politic in India is divided. No one is allowed to marry out of his own caste, or to exercise any calling or art except his own: for instance, a soldier cannot become a husbandman, or an artizan a philosopher. "
- Ancient Hindu legal texts, such as the Manu-smRRiti, favored the maintenance of the varNa system - for example, by enjoining the rulers not to let the shUdra-s become too powerful, by fixing higher standards of behavior and harsher punishments for people of higher varNa-s, by emphasizing the need for close cooperation between the brAhmaNa-s and the kShatriya-s. Many Hindu kings were proud of maintaining the varNa-Ashrama-dharma.
- Xuan Zang \[[XZ_GB](https://books.google.com/books?id=oNhVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=With+respect+to+the+division+of+families+there+are+four+classifications.+The+first+is+called+the+Brahman,+men+of+pure+conduct.&source=bl&ots=lp-gckTVmi&sig=BwGuD_a8UlvF7xrJGXnGpvFMVQw&hl=sa&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAWoVChMIgLyk4uD8xgIVlVyICh3Epgl9#v=onepage&q=With%20respect%20to%20the%20division%20of%20families%20there%20are%20four%20classifications.%20The%20first%20is%20called%20the%20Brahman%2C%20men%20of%20pure%20conduct.&f=false)\]
    - "With respect to the division of families there are four classifications. The first is called the Brahman, men of pure conduct. They guard themselves in religion live purely, and observe the most correct principles.he second is called Kshattriya, the royal class: they apply themselves to virtue and kindness. The third is called Vaisyas, the merchant class:they engage in commercial exchange, and they follow profit at home and abroad. The fourth is called Sudra, the agricultural class: they labor in plowing and tillage. ... In these four classes purity or impurity of caste assigns to every one place. When they marry they rise or fall according to their new relationship."
- Alberuni confirms \[[ALB](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/pages/ldpd_5949073_001_00000155.html?toggle=text&menu=maximize&top=200px&left=70px)\]:
    - "The kings of antiquity, who were industriously devoted to the duties of their office, spent most of their care on the division of their subjects into different classes and orders, which they tried to preserve from intermixture and disorder. Therefore they forbade people of different classes to have intercourse with each other, and laid upon each class a particular kind of work or art and handicraft. They did not allow any body to transgress the limits of his class."

### Acquisition of kShatriya status

- See the 'changing varNa-s' bullet in the [varNa theory page](../varna-theory/).
- A huge number of non-kShatriya ruling classes in the past 2500 years.
    - shudra-origin dynasties like: maurya-s, nairs of keraLa ([samAnta xatriyatA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Kshatriya)), marATha feudatories (including shivaji's bhonsle-s, scindiya-s, holkar-s), choLa-s.
    - brAhmaNa-origin ruling dynasties like: suga-s, peshva-s, kadamba-s.
- Examples of ascent through (allegedly false) lineage claims
    - shivAjI
- Examples of ascent through special rites
    - hiraNyagarbha rite was supposedly attested as early as 4 ce in Andhra, later by dantidurga the rAShTrakUTa and later in keraLa.
    - In the place of kShatriya-s, for example, we had Samanta Kshatriya-s in keraLa ( [W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Kshatriya), ie. shUdra-s who function like kShatriya-s for most practical, if not ceremonial, purposes ).
        - In traditional texts and treatises on Kerala such as the Kerala Mahatmayam and Keralolpathi the nair rulers are referred to as "sAmanta kShatriyas" (Kshatriyas only in function, not jAti). This was because swaroopams/royal families had political and social power but were Kshatriya only in profession and were not recognized as Kshatriya within the Vedic tradition per se.
        - The first ascension of these Nairs to Kshatriya status was begun by the Kolathiri Raja, Udayavarman, who wished to wear the Yajnopaveetham (Poonool or sacred thread) and become an officially recognized Kshatriya. Since the Nambudiris were not prepared, Udayavarman brought 237 families (Saagara Brahmins) of Illams from Gokarnam in 1617 AD (792 ME) and settled them in five Desams, Cheruthazham, Kunniriyam, Arathil, Kulappuram and Vararuchimangalam of Perinchelloor Graamam. 
        - "The Raja of Cochin, who was elevated to the Suryavanshi clan of the Kshatriya caste by the Namboothiri openly insulted the Zamorin, who belonged to the Eradi subdivision of Samantan Nair caste, calling him a cowherd. Zamorin tried to elevate himself to the Samanta Kshatriya status by performing the Hiranyagarbha Yagna, but fierce opposition by his opponents (Most notable of whom were the Maharaja of Cochin) forced the Namboothiris of Malabar to abandon the plan. Instead the Zamorin, who was an ordinary Nair was elevated to the Samantan Nair caste by performing the Padmagarbha Yagna."
        - "The Raja of Travancore, however used to perform an extraordinary ceremony known as Hiranyagarbha. The essential feature of this ceremony was the casting of a hollow golden vessel through which the Raja passed. On emerging from the vessel, the Raja's caste status rose from Samanthan Nair to Samanta Kshatriya. Unfortunately for the royal family, the Samanta Kshatriya status so acquired was not hereditary, and thus the ceremony had to be performed for each new Raja. The Samanta Kshatriya and Samanthan Nair subdivision were minute. For example, In Travancore in 1931, the Samanta Kshatriya population was 3,673 (0.07% of the total population), and the Samanthan NairSamanta Kshatriya population was recorded as less than 0.1% of the total population; for 1921, the Samanthan Nair population was given as 4,663 (0.15%). - [MK](http://malayalakshatriya.blogspot.com/2011/10/nair-sub-castes.html#sthash.Ti4qrMe4.dpuf)"
- Newer kShatriya-s claimed descent from established and reputed lineages (eg. vaDiyAr-s of mysore from the yadu-s, shivAjI from the siodiya-s). mArtANDa varma, the former rAja of travencore -  [image](http://i.imgur.com/TdE1hsw.jpg).

### Ascendency to brAhmaNa-ship

- Influx of magha-brAhmaNa from the proto-Iranian haumavarga shAka-s. \[[HH](https://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/musings-on-multan/)\]
- Early inclusion into the brAhmaNa-varNa tends to be enmeshed in myth. (eg: [chitpAvana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitpavan)-s, [Śākadvīpīya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakaldwipiya_history)-s).
- Arya samAja, ISKCON etc.. conferring the saMskAra-s irrespective of family of birth.
- "For example, the Koliyans, who are weavers, and the Valluvans, who are medicine men and priests and wear the sacred thread, will not intermarry or eat with the others, and are now practically distinct castes." \[[CT06](http://archive.org/stream/castestribesofso06thuruoft/castestribesofso06thuruoft_djvu.txt)\]
- "As early as 1705 A.D. the Brahmans of Madura called in question the Patnulkarans' right to perform the annual upakarma (or renewal of the sacred thread) in the Brahman fashion. \[Eighteen members of the community were arrested by the Governor of Madura for performing this ceremony.\] The matter was taken to the notice of the Queen Mangammal, and she directed her State pandits to convene meetings of learned men, and to examine into it. On their advice, she issued a cadjan (palm leaf) sasanam (grant) which permitted them to follow the Brahmanical rites."

### Ascent to vaishya-hood  

- Arya-vaishya [inclusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arya_Vaishya#Inclusion_into_the_Vaishya_Varna) into the vaishya varNa.

### Temple archaka posts

- Specific brAhmaNa sects were traditionally given the duty and privilege of being archaka-s in temples run according to various Agama-s - More in \[[theory page](../varna-theory/)\]. Exceptions are many, including:
    - Pancaratra allows archakas to be from all castes subject to certain conditions.
        - sAttada shrIvaiShNava-s officiate in several bhajana temples. They live almost like brom in ritual cleanliness.
- Several hindu old temples in India have been officiated by non-brAhmaNa priests - a phenomenon which has increased today \[[ST](http://swordoftruth.in/non-brahmin-priests-in-south-india/)\]. In many cases, the reason has been the deity's express wishes.
    - In tamiL nADu : For mAryAmbA, paNDAram priests only. For draupadyammA, only vanniyar priests.
    - "Siruvachoor mathurakaliamman temple - priests r vanniyars. Many brahmins n other castes worship her as kuladevi. Temple used to belong to vanniyar community person before govt took over. "
    - "One of my tutelary deities is alankAri amman; pandAram caste priests. Some very famous temples such as esakki amman (saved my maternal grandfather from abhicAra) are all served by non-brahmins"
    - "At a Muthu Veeran temple, a Nitya Shiva Pujaka with a kudumi stands outside the garbagriham while a Vellalar priest performs the archanai"
    -  An Orissa temple exclusively officiated by married dalit women \[[NDTV18](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-odisha-a-temple-where-only-dalit-women-are-allowed-breaks-rules-first-time-in-400-years-1841251)\].
    - In a temple, deity's wishes are supreme
        - nandan who was indeed unfit to enter temples as per smRtis and deemed himself unfit without others telling him anything....(nobody prevented him from going) How did he enter tillai? bhagavAn gives direct command.
        - While pANan refused to keep his foot inside as it might pollute temple, Archaka adhered to his Lords command by bodily carrying him in.
- Increased admittance to temple-archaka posts:
    - New courses
        - "In 1983, the centenary year of Sri Narayana Guru, Vishal Hindu Sammelan (VHS) was organised by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in Ernakulam. The chief tantrik of the main puja conducted in the sammelan was an Ezhava and his assistant was a Namboodri. The same year saw the founding of the Thanthra Vidya Peedham (TVP) by senior life-worker (pracharak) of the RSS, Madhavanji, along with eminent Vedic scholars. ... The peetham trains youngsters in all traditional knowledge domains to become qualified priests in Kerala irrespective of their caste. In a public ceremony, the certificates were given to the students trained in TVP by none other than then junior acharya of Kanchi – Sri Jayendra Saraswathi." \[[SW17](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/dalit-priests-are-a-welcome-development-but-what-did-marxists-have-to-do-with-it)\]
        - "The University Grants Commission (UGC) introduced ‘Karma Kand’ courses which could be studied by any student irrespective of community, to become a certified priest. ...  Interestingly, the move was opposed tooth and nail by Marxists and so-called progressives.  the paurohitya (priesthood) course launched by Sanskrit Sansthan in Uttar Pradesh did become a success. The priest training course was given a support grant of Rs 14 lakh by the Human Resources Development ministry under Dr Murli Manohar Joshi." \[[SW17](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/dalit-priests-are-a-welcome-development-but-what-did-marxists-have-to-do-with-it)\]
        - "In 2011, Narendra Modi as Gujarat chief minister specifically asked Shree Somnath Sanskrit University in Saurashtra to launch the three-year diploma course of priesthood – purohityam (karmakand) and allocated Rs 22.5 lakh. ... In 2017, Madhya Pradesh too launched a similar course." \[[SW17](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/dalit-priests-are-a-welcome-development-but-what-did-marxists-have-to-do-with-it)\]
        - "There is an aagama paaThashaalaa established by Adichunchanagiri earlier head with active backing of Deve Gowda which churns out shUdra arcakas by the hundreds every year. ... Muzrai department only needs an Agama certificate."
    - Advocacy
        - "In 2006, RSS magazine Panchajanya announced in its editorial that trained priests from Scheduled Communities should be appointed as priests in all “major temples in the country”. The editorial explained that “time has come to strengthen Hindu unity and ensure that along with those priests who are born Brahmins, Dalits and other backward classes are trained and made priests”."
    - Non-brAhmaNa appointments:
        - "In 2012, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), the governing body of Hindu temples, had filled up 50 of the 100 posts for priests with non-Brahmins. What was common to both 2012 and 2017 is the presence of TVP in the interview board selecting the priests."  \[[SW17](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/dalit-priests-are-a-welcome-development-but-what-did-marxists-have-to-do-with-it)\]
- Risks and corrections:
    - One can observe poor brAhmaNa priests in old temples still tending to them.. Simply because it is their kuladhana and kuladeva. People who have applied and acquired a "job" may not have such dedication (especially in a cross-generational timescale).
    - Community specificity makes sense: vaikhAnasa archaka-s of rich temples help their cousins in poor temples.

### Intra-shUdra movement: Untouchability

- "Numerous Hindu saints and savants like Guru Ravidas, Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh tirelessly worked for eradication of untouchability. The great saint Ramanuja of South India (1017-1137) openly condemned untouchablity and adopted many so-called untouchables as his disciples. In Andhra Pradesh, Veera Brahmendra Swamy (10th century) campaigned against the evil, while Basavesvara, a minister of a Kalachuri king (1131-1167 A D) vigorously fought this practice. Again in Andhra, a minister Brahmananda Naidu of Paindu (14th century A D) had openly condemned the evil practice and even appointed an “untouchable” Hindu, named Chenna, as chief of his army." \[[source](http://www.indiatomorrow.co/nation/2025-india-must-guard-against-the-threat-of-a-post-hindu-india)\]
-   
    

### Additional ossification due to British policies

- Starting with the 19th-century, the British colonial government passed a series of laws that applied to Indians based on their religion and caste identification. 
- ... The British colonial government, for instance, enacted the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871. ...  the criminal-by-birth castes under this Act included initially Ahirs, Gujars and Jats, but its enforcement expanded by late 19th century to include most Shudras and untouchables such as Chamars,\[176\] as well as Sanyassis and hill tribes. Castes suspected of rebelling against colonial laws and seeking self rule for India, such as the previously ruling families Kallars and the Maravars in south India and non-loyal castes in north India such as Ahirs, Gujars and Jats, were called "predatory and barbarian" and added to the criminal castes list.
- The British colonial officials, for instance, enacted laws such as the Land Alienation Act in 1900 and Punjab Pre-Emption Act in 1913, listing castes that could legally own land and denying equivalent property rights to other census-determined castes. These acts prohibited the inter-generational and intra-generational transfer of land from land-owning castes to any non-agricultural castes, thereby preventing economic mobility of property and creating consequent caste barriers in India. \[W\]
- So, the British altered the hierarchy of castes- and may have contributed to further ossification by making marital and other intercourse between the castes affected by these changes less likely.

### Increased fluidity due to Hindu activism

- Many people and movements in the past two centuries (Vivekananda, Dayanand sarasvatI, nArAyaNa guru), for example, have advocated moving to a more fluid social system.
    - Revolutionary birsa muNDa was taught vAlmIki-rAmAyaNa, bhagavadgItA, and initiated with the yajJNOpavIta. \[[YTClip](https://youtu.be/HtJ0dUJ8N-4?list=WL&t=2874)\]

In modern times: See [here](../modern-caste-politics/).  

## kShatriya-varNa

- Many a ruler aspired to act and be treated like a kShatriya, whether or not he could reliably trace his lineage to an ancient kShatriya line descending from the sun, moon or fire.
    - Examples of acquisition of kShatriya-status : see social fluidity section.
- Before the muslim invasion, the kShatriya varNa was widespread - even in south India (this is sometimes disputed by some neophytes).
    - vIra ballALa the hoysala, famously told malik kafur that he is willing to give up everything except his sacred thread.
    -  chulavamsha clearly describes the buddhist sinhalese king parAkrama bAhu of lanka undergoing upanayanam ([MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/some-inquiries-into-the-shrilankan-past/), [GB](https://books.google.com/books?id=RvuDlhpvvHwC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=parakramabahu+upanayana&source=bl&ots=b1ZnfUhpYj&sig=qrqioDBgT8uwLOa0r3fSlLdGNfk&hl=sa&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIwOD90rn5xgIViTOICh1PkwWv#v=onepage&q=parakramabahu%20upanayana&f=false)).
    - the kadamba-s of karNATaka were famously brAhmaNa-s converted to kShatriya-s.
    - Many dynasties of India, including south Indian ones such as chAlukya, pANDya and choLa kings conducted vedic yAga-s allowed for kShatriya-s such as rAjasUya and ashvamedha.
        - Some images, supposedly of these kings, show a yajJNOpavIta ([NVP_F](http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2819/stories/20110923281908400.htm), [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/Fk8LeLT.jpg)), while others don't (simhaviShNu-pallava [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/OJZIvJ8.jpg), [IMG2](http://i.imgur.com/IHak7fl.jpg)).
    - It is quite possible that the vijayanagara kings were not invested with the yajnopavIta - they're not known to have performed the vedic sacrifices. (This despite their great scholarship in sanskrit, patronage of temples etc..)
    - I should also note that names ending with "varma" try to claim ceremonial (not just de-facto) kShatriya status - that suffix is prescribed by the dharmashAstra-s for kShatriya-s. mArtANDa-varma, narasimhavarma pallava etc..
- As a parable, consider this story from the animal kingdom: [MT](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/the-parable-of-the-kshatriya-s/).
