title: Settlement of India
---
## Initial hominid settlement
- Narmada cranial fragment is believed to be H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP. [{MT}](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/giant-volcanos-and-humans/)
- Exact date of modern human entry as well as the effect of the giant Toba volcano explosion on Indian hominid population is unclear. [{MT}](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/giant-volcanos-and-humans/)
  - "Likewise, previous archaeological studies have recovered actual human fossils from only around 31,000 years (the Shri Lankan caves), though there are poorly studied assemblages of earlier stone tools from main land India."

## Pre-aryan human settlement
- There were early hunter gatherer (=IHG) groups - Australonesian type, currently reflected in isolated Indian tribes.
- IVC (see below) + IHG gave rise to ancestral south Indians (ASI) - prominent amongst whom were proto-Dravidians.

### IVC area
Indus Valley civilization (IVC) area were settled by a people heavy in Iranian Farmer input (over a prior IHG substrate).

- The shudra-s, early enemy of the Arya-s, may have been part of these people. \[[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/990301565436284935)\]
- A prominent theory is that these people were referred to by neighboring civilizations as Meluḫḫa or Melukhkha (later giving rise to sanskrit mlecCha) \[[W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meluhha)\].

Other notes:  

- South Indian jAti distinctness predates Aryan arrival \[[NG](http://press.nationalgeographic.com/2012/11/28/southern-india-caste-system-indo-europeans-genographic/#.UlnHJmsTfFw.twitter)12, [PLOS](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050269)\].

#### Language and script
The language and script of these people remains a mystery.
- Identification
    - Elamite of neighboring SW Iran is a strong candidate for a relative.
    - Others point to Dravidian () and a proto Elamo Dravidian model (which is rather untenable - George Starostin [here](http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/elam.pdf)).
    - The Burushaski isolate is another candidate.
- Features
    - "karpAsa was indeed the Harappan word for cotton&shamali wood was also from that language. Also kInAsha: farmer, kulAla: potter, kaivarta: fisherman etc." \[[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/990301565436284935)\]

The (more credible) AIT narrative of Bronze age events.  

### Old home
Indo-Aryans initially resided in the area around/ beyond the Black Sea, and were familiar with cold and long dawns (as evidenced by some parts of the Vedic texts - long ashvina-shastra to be recited at dawn). This is supported by genetic studies such as - [N15](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151116/ncomms9912/full/ncomms9912.html). Even in the ancient past, they were a composite people \[[MTTW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/739516248522915840)\].

### Rapid radiation
They radiated out widely, merged with and dominated prior occupants in vast tracts of Eurasia. \[[Vid2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdQwalCPNAs)\]
- Eurpoean migration: [Nat](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v522/n7555/full/nature14317.html), [Arx](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02783.pdf).
- Half of Western European men descended from one Bronze Age ‘king’. "In Western Europe, related lineages within R1b-L11 expanded ~4.8–5.9 kya (Supplementary Fig. 14e), most markedly around 4.8 and 5.5 kya. The earlier of these times, 5.5 kya, is associated with the origin of the Bronze Age Yamnaya culture." \[[N16](http://www.nature.com.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3559.html) [T](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/04/25/half-of-british-men-descended-from-one-bronze-age-king/)16 \]
- Greek waves:
    - "One of the causes for the end of the Mycenaean civilization is held to be the invasion of another Greek group the Dorians. In Greek epics these invasions are believed to represent the return of the Heracleidai, he descendents of Herakles who set out to conquer Greece from the other rulers. From the historical view point it is interesting to note that the use of the script declined after the Dorian invasion even though the Dorians were Greek speakers and could have easily adapted the Linear B themselves." \[[MT11](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/homers-illiteracy/)\]
- Central Asian waves led to close interaction with mongoloid people .:
    - More [here](../../../../paganology/steppe/).

#### Genes, memes, temes
What genes, memes or temes put them at an advantage?

- Technological and biological theories
    - "wheel in terms of technology & ideology played a serious role in this. The former especially because whatever else they did rapidly get from 1 place to another. " [MT18](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/962865458687946753).
    - The people who spoke the Proto-Indo-European language lived at a critical time in a strategic place. They were positioned to benefit from innovations in transport, most important of these being the beginning of horseback riding and the invention of wheeled vehicles. \[David W. Anthony in "Indo-Europeans, The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World"\]
    - " It has been proposed that the horse and chariot tradition frequently mentioned by some poets associated with Chu state might be a further marker of this contact. It indeed appears that the chariot and the equestrian culture were transmitted on one or even more occasions from the Indo-Iranians. It appears that a robust equestrian warfare arose somewhat later than the chariot culture (often linked to the need for the stirrup for effective warfare). Proto-Indo-Iranian tradition, while aware of horseback riding and equestrian warfare, placed much greater emphasis on the chariot in war and does not seem to record a stirrup." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)\]
    - Lactose tolerance theory (discredited by genetic studies): Indo-Europeans developed a gene mutation that allowed them to digest milk even after being weaned, thus providing these nomads with a continuous and mobile source of nutrition.
- However, the dharma memeplex (../see [here](../dharma/)) is probably the most important competitive edge they had.  

#### Textual provenance
- Spacio-temporal coordinates
    - "RV shows clear knowledge of specific geothermal phenomena in the Caspian region. Further, its astronomical references compared with those of the Yajurveda and the Vedāñga Jyotiṣa point to dates certainly certainly earlier to ~3500-3200 YBP and even before the earliest Sintashta chariots, perhaps closer to 5000 YBP than 4000 YBP. These dates, while well-known to Hindu scholars since Tilak, are routinely ignored by white indologists as fantasies of the Hindus despite early acknowledgment of the same in their midst by Jacobi. ... as discussed earlier it does match with other features like: 1) near lack of rice agriculture and dominance of barley; 2) the rarity of the sword and the gadā (which can be associated with Sintashta/Andronovo) as war weapons; 3) hardly any mention of the complex society with multiple service castes found in the Yajurveda brāhmaṇa-s and ritual. " \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/a-note-on-the-cow-the-horse-and-the-chariot-in-the-%E1%B9%9Bgveda/)17\]
- Economy and culture
    - "we can paint some aspect of the lives of the ārya-s based on the RV: They were different from the later horse-centric pastoralists like the steppe Iranians (e.g. śaka-s) and Altaic peoples for whom the horse was primary and the cow marginal. In contrast, for the ārya-s the cow was central to their nutrition and economy and the horse played a central military role. While the ārya-s certainly rode horses, its military role in that period was apparently not so much as direct mount as much as for drawing the war-chariot. Accordingly, the chariot was an important symbol of power. This, expressed itself in the form of the chariot/horse races which were an important form of contest, entertainment and ritual. Further, unlike the later horse-centric steppe pastoralists the ārya-s did practice some agriculture even before they arrived in the Indian subcontinent and seemed to have focused on barley cultivation. Here, again cattle were clearly central; they drew the plow, concomitant with which seeding of the furrows took place. Thus, the economy of the ārya-s was necessarily a mixed one combining both cattle-rearing and agriculture. Other than horse with its special military role, goats and sheep were also reared with the latter supplying wool which is mentioned in the RV. However, notably there is no mention whatsoever of cotton." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/a-note-on-the-cow-the-horse-and-the-chariot-in-the-%E1%B9%9Bgveda/)17\]

### Indian entry : IVC + Aryas = ANI
Genetic, linguistic and textual evidence indicates that culturally Indo-Aryan people entered and mixed with "proto-Indian" people around the Indus Valley civilization, forming a hybrid people (aka Ancenstral North Indian - ANI). Later still, they mixed with Dravidian (ancestral south Indian - ASI) and Asiatic people in the south and east.

- Etymology of "Arya": [KE2015](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-indo-european-vedic-and-post-vedic.html).
- Timing: "1st they say that between 1700-1500 BCE there is East Asian admixture in C As Steppe pops which is absent in Indian groups.2nd they say that Steppe ancestry seen in BMAC first ~2100 BCE. So that gives us a rather narrow window of when the Arya-s reached the subcontinent." \[MT on [201803](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/31/292581.full.pdf)\]

#### Multiple waves
- "We suspect that similarly there were multiple waves of Indo-European invasions into India. Most of these were waves were Indo-Aryans or at best Iranians, though there might have additionally even been a kentum type non-Indo-Iranian wave – sort of a mirror image of the western branch of Indo-Aryans (Mittani superstrate) that appeared in West Asia \[Footnote 2\]. We discern several such waves based on Indo-Aryan literary tradition: 1) The pa~nchajana (who may have come in more than one wave); 2) the ikShvAku (these two are early waves); 3) the shalva-s; 4) the pANDava-s" \[[MT11](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/homers-illiteracy/)\]
    - "The late RV sarayu and gomati were to the west. They were later moved east perhaps indeed with the movement of ikShavAkus" \[[TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/900515059289423873)\].
- " As we have tentatively argued before there appears to have been an older layer involving a civil war within the kuru-pa~nchAla confederation in core AryAvarta. In this confrontation, the kuru-s might have destroyed the pa~nchAla-s, perhaps via the action of the feral bharadvAja brAhmaNa ashvatthAman.  The larger canvas of these events appears to have included conflicts with another Indo-Aryan state of the salva-s who were initially defeated by the kuru-s and subsequently destroyed by the yadu-s under kR^iShNa devakIputra and his allies. Another group, the nAga-s, called by some as non-Aryan, were in reality most certainly culturally Arya. This group was also contending for power in this period against the yadu-s led by kR^iShNa.  The pANDu-s coming from the Iranian border zone appear to have subsequently emerged as key players. Initially they allied with the yadu-s to gain territory from the nAga-s. This sparked off a long standing feud between the latter and the pANDu-s with some nAga groups allying themselves to the pANDu-s and other fiercely opposing them. Subsequently, the pANDu alliance destroyed the surviving kuru power in alliance with the remnants of the pa~nchAla-s and the yadu-s. Finally they placed themselves as rulers after completing the destruction of the nAga power. Their joint queen draupadI appear to symbolically represent the shrI or the wealth and power of the old pa~nchAla monarchs, which was now in the hands of the pANDu-s though the former had no successors.... This secondary wave along with others might be associated with the transformation of Vedic India into the early “classical” India wherein new religious systems, concepts and deities were superimposed upon the earlier shrauta system formalized in the kuru-pa~nchAla realm. It is conceivable that archaeologically they correspond to the famous Painted Grey Ware culture of northern India. Despite their huge cultural effect, their own direct political contribution was limited. There are few India dynasties that consistently claim origin from the pANDu-s." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/the-successors-of-the-kaunteya-s-in-the-national-memory-of-bharata-s-and-bhota-s-and-related-discursions/)\]
- First wave
    - " the study of the ethnogenesis of the Indians suggests that the main Indo-Aryan contribution came from the invasion of a population close to the Yamnaya of the early steppe Bronze age rather than the Sinthasta or its successors Andronovo culture which descended from the Yamnaya. This is also more consistent with the estimates for the dates of expansion of the “Indian” branch of the R1a1 Y-haplogroup which is associated with the invasion of India by the ārya-s." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/a-note-on-the-cow-the-horse-and-the-chariot-in-the-%E1%B9%9Bgveda/)\]

### Spread within India
- From baudhAyana and manu, it is clear that kuru-pAnchAla realm was where major brAhmaNa vedic consolidation happened. Gradually, this culture and its carriers (mainly in the form of brAhmaNa-s) spread elsewhere in India and beyond. {[GA_17](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/926791318109429761)}
  - baudhAyana-dharma-sUtra implies that vaidika karma-s can only be conducted in the "madhya-desha", not even in kalinga, vanga, AraTTa, gAndhAra etc.. - going where expiation is required \[[TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/874755837155082240)\]. Yet, we observe baudhAyana-s and vaidika-s in kerala and TN.
  - "Almost none of the elite definitions: brahmavarta, brahmaRSidesha or madhyadesha. That region is indeed sacred for all Hindus today but there was a time when it was not held in high esteem by the kurupa~ncalas/madhyadeshis. In the baudhAyana shrauta sUtra, right after choosing the priests for his yaj~na, a yajamAna has to "deposit" all evils & illnesses in him in various "safe" places which were deemed suitable for storing those undesirable elements - It starts, "my anger in a lion, hunger in wolf..." & later has "may my bile (excess) settle among ikSvAkus & elephantisis among videhas"!!"
- Also see "Brahmanas -> Penetration and Aryanization" note below and the [varNa-theory page](../varna-theory/) regarding the "crossing the seas" prohibition.  
- "Can estimate that approximately at least 50% of the Y-chromosomes of  varNa populations as a group originated from invading Aryan males." See note on R1a1 in Genetics page.
- Some of the proto-Indian tribal population was incorporated into the fringes of evolving Indo-Aryan society as specialized service communities, while the rest retained their tribal existence with a symbiotic relationship with the Arya-s. The encounter and the with the tribal groups is seen in many different forms in the post-R^igveda texts of the Indo-Aryans.

### Dravidian bloom
- In the meantime, they met, and culturally influenced Dravidian language speakers, leading to acquisition of beneficial meme-plexes. They, as a consequence, expanded in to peninsular India, mixing and linguistically dominating the proto-Indian tribes. 
- This is indicated  \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/725906932431613952/photo/1) [N16](http://www.nature.com.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3559.html)\] by estimated time of L1 haplotype's blooming after the blooming of the R1a haplotype.
- **Cambodian example**. In this same manner they were to later influence South East Asia \[[Muj](https://twitter.com/ColonelGerard/status/504770071411961856)\]. ~5% of Cambodian ancestry seems to be Indian! \[[RK16](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-indian-ocean-as-humanitys-pond/#comment-1555053)\]
    - Its later fall was due to rise of Islam and rise of of the Viet at the expense of the Champa. The Tai warbands and many others were assimilated by Indics \[[RK16](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/genetics-as-thor-heyerdahls-revenge/)\]. 

### Positivity of Aryan and Iranian farmer influx.

Its positivity:

- The portrayal of this Aryan migration as some sort of a negative event underlies denial of Aryan migration by reactionary hindu-s. It is combined with misinformation and used as a political tool by Dravidian politicians, communists, missionaries etc..
- Rather, it was a positive event with the heathen cultural ideal of transforming the land into AryAvarta, which involved development of symbiotic relationships.
- Pagan consolidation and dominance

### Hindu reactions to AIT

#### Embracing AIT

Shrikant Taligeri has a section on the "Hindu Invasionist School"​, quoting fine patriots like BG TiLak, S.D. Kulkarni and vIra sAvarkar supporting AIT.  

- ""V.D. (Veer) Savarkar, who more or less accepted Tilak’s hypothesis,takes equal pride in the “achievements” of the Aryans, but is less inclined to stress the “extermination” of the inferior races, and, infact, tries to suggest that the non-Aryans were relatively few  in number, and that most of them welcomed the Aryan invaders with open arms.""

#### AIT phobia

- Causes
    - "Political aspect of the whole debate lies in the potential of and past use of the Aryan Invasion /Immigration Theory to justify the Muslim/ British invasion of India and opposition to and ridiculing of the Indian Freedom Struggle or Indian National Movement on that basis."
    - "It also has connections with norh Indians and upper castes particularly Brahmins being picturized as the ancient invaders of India and other Indians being victims of that from ages." \[[BVP17](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/ynh97Vw2Cnk/58B8967QAgAJ)\]
- Manifestation among Indian geneticists
    - Confused statements from Indian authors of [Nature2009](http://www.nature.com.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/nature/journal/v461/n7263/full/nature08365.html) (Lalji, Thiagarajan) : [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/a-note-on-some-recent-work-on-india-genetics/) , exposition [BVP16](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/yUHi_V9tS8Y/03qB1C8PCgAJ).
    - Anand \[[NL](https://www.newslaundry.com/2014/08/11/indiana-jones-and-the-troublesome-aryans)14\], Chaubey \[[SW17](https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/genetics-might-be-settling-the-aryan-migration-debate-but-not-how-left-liberals-believe)\].

#### Treating AIT phobia

- "this reaction is based in folly and a sad sign of our current intellectual state. One can quite easily be a abhimAni hindu, accept evidence in favor of AIT and repudiate enemy narratives (just think of the great patriot bAlagangAdhara TiLak). We don't even need to be apologetic about any Aryan Invasion, dominance and consolidation (quite the opposite - we can derive pride in it and explore exactly why such stunning success came to pass) - all we have to do is reject the fake equivalence of Aryan invasion with the genocidal invasions of the mlecCha-s in India, the America-s and Australia (which is exactly what PV kANe did - never spilt any ink propping OIT up AFAIK)." \[[BVP17](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/ynh97Vw2Cnk/58B8967QAgAJ)\]
- "​Furthermore, वीरभोग्या वसुन्धरा - nature does not care for moral justifications like "oh we're unjust victims of atrocious foreign dominance. we never did such a thing to others". That's so defeatist and pitiable (besides being false).​ Who are we trying to convince? Does the Pakistani or Chinese nationalist waste any breath justifying his aggression or defense on some inane theory of moral superiority?"  \[[BVP17](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/ynh97Vw2Cnk/58B8967QAgAJ)\]

### The OIT narrative (far less credible):

#### Key evidence
- "The master key for discerning historical expansions and migrations is the internal chronology of the Rg-Veda. Basing himself on two centuries of Western scholarship, from 19th-century German Veda scholar Oldenburg to present-day AIT champion Prof. Michael Witzel, Talageri compares the contents of the oldest layer, largely coinciding with books 6, 3 and 7; of the middle layer, books 2 and 4; and the youngest layer, comprising books 1, 5, 8, 9 and 10. Covering every verse and every instance of every category considered, and comparing the three periods, he finds a shifting focus in the names of animals, plants, rivers, landscape features, technology, ancestors, ethnic groups, and in personal name types and verse forms. " \[[KE15](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.ca/2009/01/great-book-about-great-book.html), [KE_L15](https://www.academia.edu/14458226/Why_Linguistics_necessarily_holds_the_key_to_the_solution_of_the_Indo-European_Homeland_question)\]
    - "Another emigrant group is the one whose settlement has been dug up in Sintashta, on the eastern slopes of the Ural mountains in Russia. This is where the oldest horse-drawn chariots have been found, dated to ca. 2000 BC. The burials show a number of ritual features which Witzel has connected to the Rigveda in a bid to buttress his thesis that the Sintashta people were proto-Indo-Aryans on the way to India. But of each of these features, including the fabled horse sacrifice, Talageri shows that they are typical of the late period of the Rigveda, unattested in the older periods. "
- Absence of non-IE place-names (which are usually heavily conserved) in north India
    - (Can in part be explained by the vyutpatti power of sanskrit.)

#### Problems
##### Genetic
- "They show that the massive expansion of R1a happened in India coevally with that of R1b in Europe and both the Indian and the European R1 haplogroups occur together only in the ancient steppe DNA recovered by Reich in the time range of 5,500-4,000 YBP. The timeline of R1a expansion in India has now been accurately determined to no earlier than 4,500 YBP. ... Therefore, unless new genetic evidence surfaces which testifies to the simultaneous occurrence of R1a and R1b in India in the time range of 5,500-4,000 YBP, OIT cannot be resurrected." \[[KV16](https://kalavaivenkat.wordpress.com/2016/05/07/musings-on-ait-genetics-and-accusations-of-racism/)[N16](http://www.nature.com.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3559.html) [H17](http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-genetics-is-settling-the-aryan-migration-debate/article19090301.ece)\] 
- " But the idea that most of the ancestry of South Asians dates to the last Ice Age, that is, the Indo-Aryan invasion was demographically marginal, was a defensible position until recently. For example, in 2006 you have a paper such as [Polarity and Temporality of High-Resolution Y-Chromosome Distributions in India Identify Both Indigenous and Exogenous Expansions and Reveal Minor Genetic Influence of Central Asian Pastoralists](http://genetics.stanford.edu/hpgl/publications/AJHG_2006_v78_p202-221.pdf). Additionally, as individuals have pointed out to me ad nauseam, archaeologists are skeptical of mass migration because of lack of remains. First, a paper from 2006 is wildly out of date for this field. The methods used have been superseded. Instead of using one locus, the Y chromosome, and focusing on microsatellites (which have upsides and downsides), researchers now look at the whole genome." \[[RK16](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-aryan-invasion-was-not-fantasy/#comments)\]

##### Linguistic
- "In The Indo-Iranian Substratum, Alexander Lubatsky points out that the oldest borrowings into Finno-Ugric (FU) are from IA and not IIr. The speakers of FU didn’t live in the vicinity of India. Their contacts with the IE speakers happened further to the West. If OIT were correct then one must expect IIr speakers to have constituted the vanguard in the westward out flux from India and transmitted loan words into FU. It would’ve resulted in the attestation of IIr loans in the oldest strata of FU. However, that is not the case. The loan words in the oldest strata are from IA which suggests that they were directly transmitted from IA to FU." \[[KV16](https://kalavaivenkat.wordpress.com/2016/05/07/musings-on-ait-genetics-and-accusations-of-racism/)\]

## Consolidation (jAti + varNa)  

### Early Arya society  

#### varNa formation
Late Rg vedic hymns and the other veda-s show distinct varNa-s.
- The four major ones (brAhmaNa, kShatriya, vaiShya, shUdra) and other subcategories - rathakAra-s, niShAda-s and chaNDAla-s.
    - iranian Avesta as well (athravan, rathestar, vastrya on one hand with huiti as 4th - a later term)
- Earlier, only the brAhmaNa, kShatriya, vaiShya varNa-s may have existed.
- Dumézil hypothesized that [Proto-Indo-European society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_society) comprised three main groups corresponding to three distinct functions the function of [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) (which inturn comprised of formal and priestly categories), the [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military) function and the function of [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture). \[[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifunctional_hypothesis)\]
- For notes on how a hierarchical structure might have yielded a competitive advantage, see [here](../varna-theory/).  

### Early Arya vs shUdra conflict  
- Arya-s and dAsyu-s/ dAsa-s (mentioned int he Rg-veda) were enemies - differentiated by race(?) and culture. After subjugating the latter, they became shUdra-s in early Aryan society. (PV Kane)
    - Possible connection: Western shaka-s (who recided on the west coast of black sea) referred to themselves as skudra-s \[[SZ](http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/fouroldiranianethnicnames.pdf), [दारयवः](http://i.imgur.com/NOgGytU.png)।\].
- "The post R^igvedic texts allude to the Arya vs shUdra conflict and the brahma+kShatra vs shUdra conflicts. The mAnava dharmashAstra (manu smR^iti) and allied material alludes to the same 2 above-mentioned conflicts. ... Yet it is fairly plain from the manu smR^iti that the shUdra is feared as a danger to brAhmaNa-s. The same is true of the vaguer vedic allusions, where they are a threat to the Aryas or the brahma-kShatra aristocracy. " \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
    - "It should stated here that this clearly contrasts the situation with the vaishyas. They are after all the “vish (people)” or the laity who function as traders and cultivators and should have the resources to for the brahma-kShatra or brahmin overlord to exploit. Further, given their resources they could actually mobilize a threat to the dominion of the aristocrats. Yet, there is no sense of hostile interactions vis-a-vis the vaishyas in the texts under discussion. They are discussed, variously, as Arya insiders or miscellaneous dvijas using a neutral or common-place terminology. This presents a major contradiction, for why should the brahma-kShatra, who were believed to be in power in Hindu society, fear the lowest group rather than the potential more dangerous vaishyas whom they are believed exploit. This is also in contrast with the generally neutral or positive treatment of the “low caste” trades which may be at the border of vaishya and shudra functions. The texts both vedic and the MDS, consider these trades and their practitioners a necessary feature of society that needs protection. So the sense of threat from the hostile shUdra suggests that term ‘shUdra’ was not merely applied to the lowest caste but actually extended to enemy of the brahmin or the brahma-kShatra alliance." \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
    - "MDS 10.129 warns that shUdras on acquiring wealth could harass brahmins. Importantly, this is never stated of vaishyas who have the potential to do so. MDS 8.22 warns that a kingdom teeming with shUdra-run courts rapidly degenerates as though over-run by enemies of dvijas. MDS4.60-61 again mentions that the brAhmaNa should avoid residence in a shUdra kingdom, which is described as being over-run with inimical people and having practitioners of fake religions." \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
    - "The redaction of the ancient law-books, which were in their core kuru-pa~nchala documents (as supported by their definition of Aryavarta=the kuru-pa~nchala realm; the territory of the bhAratas or sometime their feudatories and allies, the yadus and matsyas), seems to have occurred during the maurya, shu~Nga and kANva periods. These redactions were characterized by inclusion of negative references with respect to shudra, a term which specifically subsumed the recent hostile elements that the brahma-kShatra alliance had faced. However, the vedic references suggest that the redactors were not being innovative in this regard. It is clear that there was an ancient hostile sub-text to the shUdra term, as enemies of the Aryas. This parallels the term dAsa, that in ancient sanskrit literature was typically an individual or group hostile to the Aryans, but later also came to mean slave. These terminologies definitely have a link to the subjugation of hostile enemies and their eventual assimilation at the lower social rungs. So in conclusion, I would state that the entire enterprise of searching for a doctrine of oppression in negative statements regarding the shUdras in the MDS and allied texts is a rather misplaced venture. These texts are a product of a certain historical conflicts, where the brahma-kShatra alliance is merely seen to be defending its interests against competitors and threats. Whether, their texts or their interpretations based on misunderstood terminologies were basis of social inequities, which are very natural in primate societies, is highly questionable.

- People living outside the domain of early Aryan society (south Indians, persians, chinese etc..) were considered fallen kShatriya-s, and now shUdra-s and called dasyu-s; having lost their saMskAra-s. \[[PVK_IMG](http://i.imgur.com/lWjiQD4.jpg), MDS 10.43-45\]
- shUdra-s of early Aryan society had very low status, with their main profession being the service of the dvija-s.
    - BR Ambedkar's summary seems mostly correct : 
        - "for the Shudras of the Indo-Aryan Society are absolutely different in race from the Shudras of the Hindu Society. The Shudras of the Hindu Society are not the racial descendants of the Shudras of the Indo-Aryan Society. This confusion has arisen because of the failure to realise that the meaning of the word 'Shudras' in the Indo-Aryan society is quite different from the meaning it has in the Hindu society. In the Indo-Aryans the word Shudra was proper name of one single people. It was the name of a people who belonged to a particular race. The word Shudra, as used in the Hindu society, is not a proper name at all. It is an epithet for a low uncultured class of people. It is a general cognomen of a miscellaneous and heterogeneous collection of tribes and groups, who have nothing in common except that they happen to be on a lower plane of culture. It is wrong to call them by the name Shudras. They have very little to do with their namesakes of the Aryan society, who had offended the Brahmins."
        - "We do not know exactly whether the Shudras were a tribe, a clan or a moiety or a group of families. But even if they were as big as a tribe, they could not have been larger than a few thousand. The Bharatas are being expressly spoken of in the Rig Veda, vii.33.6, as being small in number."

### Early trends in fluidity
- In the far antiquity, intermarriage among varNa-s must have been permitted.
    - Consider the tale of [satyavatI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyavati) (when the marriage was proposed, neither bhIShma nor shantanu knew the supposed kShatriya origins of satyavatI).
- Later internal sources view mixing of the varNa-s with scorn.
    - dharmashAstra-s.
    - The famous stance of the bhagavadgItA against varNa-sankara.
- By the time Megasthenes visited, there were already rigid restrictions about intermarriage and avocations. \[[MI](http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/upload/Megasthene-Indika.pdf)\]
    - " Such, then, are about the parts into which the body politic in India is divided. No one is allowed to marry out of his own caste, or to exercise any calling or art except his own: for instance, a soldier cannot become a husbandman, or an artizan a philosopher. "
- **Further history** is considered [here](../varna-theory/).

### vaidika brAhmaNa glue

#### Vaidika ideals
The **vaidika ideals** (../deva-s, xAtra, dharma, brahman, yajna ... mentioned in [the intro](../../hinduism/introduction/)) easily lend themselves to the development of virile, yet harmonious and composite polytheistic **rAShTra**-s (states).
- The polycentric and adaptible vaidika ideals were quite acceptable to non-vaidika pagans.  

- Further, the sheer sophistication of the continually developing vedAnga-s and kala-s were very attractive to vedic and non-vedic pagans alike.  

#### Ritualist conservative core
- Conservation of core vaidika ideas over millennia and across genepool-shifts involved evolution of a well-developed and influential ritualist caste (brAhmaNa-s) with a powerful oral tradition and specifically a grammatical tradition that allowed preservation of the language, especially in ritual.

#### Attractiveness of the brAhmaNa-s  
- The brAhmaNa ability to hold and spread the attractive vedic ideals, and their tendency towards sophistication in the shAstra-s was very impressive. They were not initially limited by Ananda-addictions and (sea-faring type) taboos.
- Their sagely lifestyle had a charm to it. A brAhmaNa was ideally not to seek wealth - even via due fees for his yAjana \[aitareya brAhmaNa - [TW17](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/926064678245150720)\].  

- Further, the brAhmaNa-s were mostly not a threat to the ruling elite (kShatriya or otherwise).

#### Penetration and Aryanization
- The Aryan elite always included brAhmaNa-s. So, they initially spread with the Arya invasion.  
- Elsewhere they freely migrated (often upon invitation), bringing with them the attractive vaidika ideals and practices.
- This facilitated the gradual Aryanization (= vedicization) of the host populations - even in the languages.
- This was accompanied by brAhmaNa-s additionally learning (and even mastering) the local languages and practices - to the extant of becoming active in their preservation and flowering. Eg. brAhmaNa participation in early tamiL, kannaDa and telugu literature.  

##### Examples:
- Andhra
    - "Cynthia Talbot mined epigraphic records and labeled Vengi as the “core area” of Andhra in this period.5 Here again land grants to Brahmans were frequent and inscriptions indicate migrations from the north to Andhra. One copper plate records the donation of a village in Guntur District, west of the Krishna River, to one thousand Brahmans from the village of Ahicchatra on the Ganges." \["vedic voices" book\]
    - "Cynthia Talbot notes a special tradition in medieval Andhra, sapta-santana, “seven offerings,” by which donors could perpetuate their names.40 In addition to having a son, other legacies include provision of a deity image to a temple, constructing a tank for water supply, and donating an agrahara."   \["vedic voices" book\]
    - "Sriramapuram agrahara, established in 1940 in land grants to respected Veda pandits by a wealthy merchant, Dokka Rama, originally contained a single straight dirt lane of fourteen houses and a panca-ayatana (five-deity) temple housing Isvara, Radha-krsna, Surya, Ambika, and Vighnesvara (Ganesa)" \["vedic voices" book\]
- Cambodia \[kauNDinya dynasty [Q](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-link-between-the-Khmer-Empire-and-ancient-India), brAhmaNa priests' ceremonies [C05](https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/priests-uphold-a-unique-and-royal-tradition-50637/)\]
- Bali.

#### Continual harmonization
- This penetration was likely accompanied by acknowledgement of kShatriya status of local lords. Late examples include: shivAjI, the hiraNyagarbha ritual for nair rulers.
- More widely, the brAhmaNa-s, through the evolving dharmashAstra-s and commentaries, tried to **harmonize** the functioning of the society - to bring order out of chaos. Thus they assisted the local lords in increasing local harmony.  

#### National integration
- Besides patronage, brAhmaNa-s kept freely migrating and visiting various parts of hindu-dom in quest of mantra, shAstra and tIrtha.
- They carried with them news, lore and skills from one region to another.
- This facilitated a certain unity in spirit (../described in  [the intro](../../hinduism/introduction/)) throughout hindu abodes.
    - Example from Trinidad \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/Lsadw9y.jpg)\].
- Thus, it is no joke when one declares that without the brAhmaNa-s, there would be no India. Rather, we would have an unconsolidated set of tribes (as in most of America and Africa), ready to far more easily fall to the sword of the intolerant monotheistic blight.  


## Ultimate ethnic shifts  

- kShatriya-s
    - "The brAhmaNas (brahmins) and the kShatriyas are in essense the descendents of the aristocracy or elite families of the invading Aryans. Overtime the kShatriya fold adopted other Indo-Aryan tribes outside of the pa~nchajana-ikShvAku orthodoxy, and various “honorary” kShatriyas of diverse ethnic backgrounds. These newcomers displaced or supplemented the original kShatriyas to a significant degree." \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
- brAhmaNa-s:
    - "However, in the case of the brahmin the displacement was less significant, though there was a noticeable ethnic diversification through the process of anuloma marriage and the 7 generation rule of ascent to brahmin-hood. Nevertheless the brahmins and kshatriyas do seem to maintain a significant component of their ancestral Indo-Aryan ethnicity as supported by recent genetic studies." \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
    - "From genetic data we can now confidently say that while a major component of v1 male lines in several parts of India is from the old Arya settlers there have been Harappan and tribal male lineages who have been absorbed. So the gotra is not a perfect correlate of deep ancestry. ... The (shaiva tantra) system also served as a conduit for fast-tracking the cream
from individuals with high HG ancestry into higher varNa-s. Their incorporation into V2s is relatively well-known but now we can say that probably up to 10-15% of V1s in south India emerged via this mechanism coeval with the flowering of the shaiva traditions in the south." {[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1072321253535567873)}
- "The vaishyas- these were in chief the descendents of the Indo-Aryan laity. However, they eventually included a diverse group of individuals." \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
- shUdras- these seem to represent a mixture of individuals, namely:
    - "those of Indo-Aryan ethnic and linguistic origins, but outside of the pale of the pa~nchajana-ikShvAku orthodoxy" \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
    - "Non-Indo-Aryan peoples of various origins." \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
