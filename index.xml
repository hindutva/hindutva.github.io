However, even those who are critical of Islam say, “I am&#xA;critical of Islam but I welcome Muslims.” Somehow, the moment a&#xA;hateful ideology which spreads the worst forms of bigotry is packaged&#xA;as religion critics begin to pull punches. I would rather take a&#xA;principled stance, “I condemn Islam and I welcome ex-Muslims.”&#xA;[Unquote]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&#xA;had pulled no punches in attacking Jesus and the Bible. The terribly&#xA;annoyed missionary started his rebuttal with a sarcastic and&#xA;condescending remark: “You seem like a person of above average&#xA;intelligence. How can you worship a cow or a monkey….?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The entirely Christian audience laughed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He grips the minds of children, and the hearts of all sahRdaya-s with his cheer and compassion. Whatever his pagan origins might have been (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ibtimes.com/santa-claus-pagan-origins-5-influences-behind-father-christmas-1736863&#34;&gt;ibtimes&lt;/a&gt;), we pagans have a problem: He is intimately connected with the zombie cult. Indeed the zombie bastard child is said to have burdened the earth on the santa claus day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we hindu-s have had long experience with borrowing and hijacking of our deities as part of the competition amongst our orthodox and heterodox traditions. All one needs do is “expand” a few legends. So, lets “understand” santa claus in our terms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: A 2015-08-31 article on the net.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An appraisal about mormonism from the hindu standpoint: benefits, cohesion, barriers&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following is from a dialog amonga few friends about the LSD (sorry LDS) church.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;priesthood-levels&#34;&gt;Priesthood levels&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my mid-twenties, I had been baptised in the LDS Church. I was actively involved with various other religious groups at the time, and this I told my Mormon teachers who had been giving me lessons for a few months, but they honestly said, “Baptism is only the beginning, not the end. It only qualifies you to continue to study our theory and sacraments.” So I did. After baptism, one is automatically inducted into the first level “Aaronic priesthood”. Based on proven abilities and completed sacraments, one can rise up to higher priesthoods such as Melchizedek, etc. In many ways, the LDS Church is modeled on Freemasonry or other esoteric schools with their distinction betwen neophytes,&#xA;hierophants, adepts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The busy Abrahamists</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/12/18/the-busy-abrahamists/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learned today on the web that a certain British satirist AE Housman about whom I know hardly anything said: “In every American there is an air of incorrigible innocence, which seems to conceal a diabolical cunning.” I wonder what prompted him to make such a comment. Perhaps the Indians thought the same of the British even as he was making such comments about his cousins the Americans. We in our youth had a seen a few Anglo-Australian subversionists who had deceptively entered our school. They were like wasps trying to subvert an acorn into a gall and used a certain innocence which seemed truely incorrigible and appeared to innocently ask questions to deride Hindu deities and create doubts in their regard in the minds of the young students. We however, saw through this guise of the sUchin-s and after a protracted struggle had them overthrown. It was great day when the vicious adventurer David was finally sent packing. This white man, a good- for-nothing in his own land, had wormed his way to our school as a teacher, taking advantage of the Indian respect for the White Massas. He treated the Hindus like dirt until our mini-freedom struggle sent him packing. This is just a sample of one the Abrahmisms waging its war on the Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/29/the-mlechcha-subversionists/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have never been a great fan of many modern Hindu fads:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They include the foolish opposition to the ultimate non-Indian origin of the Indo-Aryan and their incursion into India.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The statement that all religions say the same thing only their practioners distort the “Truth”. This is especially frightening ignorance with respect to Islam and Christism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Hindus in reality worship only one god.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hindus do not believe in the evolutionary theory.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I have always held that it is up to Hindus themselves to chose their desired level of ignorance rather than be “saved” by some blathering Indologist. As I have argued before, Indologists are not all bad, their translations of the veda have given uneducated Hindus the chance to understand them at some superficial level. Without these aids, the lack of proper Sanskrit education in India may have kept the masses even more ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Indian commie leaders thundered that it was a desecration of their hero and also the Russian heritage itself. This aspect of the commie hold out in India is reminiscent of the holding out of the sister Abrahmism in India. Christianity is declining in its heartland- Europe (though it still persists as a sub-current ideology) but is vigorously pursued in India. Indians once fooled seem to follow the delusion much after the original fools are cured. One wonders why?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It ran through the Sassanian empire in no time and then expanded rapid in the East towards India, in the North East towards Central Asia, the West towards the Christian Roman empire and south towards Africa. The Sassanians fell completely and rather rapidly in Iran to the Islamic Jihad. The campaigns of Abu Muslim and Qutaiba ibn Muslim in central Asia were also widely successful. In the battle of River Talas the Arabs met with a great success against the Chinese army. In Palestine they were successful against the Christian Roman empire (Byzantines). In North Africa they devasted the Christian and pagan states and then invaded Spain and Portugal and conquered huge swaths of Christian southern Europe. Against the Hindus in India they met with considerable success in the Sindh province.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In areas where the British were prominent before the war of 1857, the indoctrination of covert Christian ideals and English superiority was underway for a while. After 1857 it spread all over the country. The Indians faced with this indoctrination reacted regionally in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In practically every Indian list one can now see them floating their anti-Brahmin rhetoric. A few hopeful brAhmaNas had told me just a few months ago that the Dravidianists were on the wane. I always doubted this. The Tamils are too useful a tool for foreign subversionists to use against the metaphorical head of the puruSha. I had also earlier pointed out that the brAhmaNas had cashed their cheques and are currently a rather spent force.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sadly for India, Hemu was wounded in the fight and fell into the hands of Akbar. The young Mohammedan tyrant gleefully stepped forward and slit the the fallen Hindu leader’s throat and acquired the title Ghazi- the wager of Jihad on the infidels, in the midst of his admiring henchmen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His ideas should, hence, be viewed as a part of the continuum of the era.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Secondly, he never visited India so he definitely had a poor grasp of the first-hand subtilties of India. His information was also being filtered through the English Raj, which was obviously the only source.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;help-for-hindus&#34;&gt;Help for Hindus&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me point out what Swami Vivekananda, a great Indian reformer and patriot said about him:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In contrast, when India has to return the fire with the occassional exception of the over-used field gun, Shrinath, the rest of the guns typically fail to fire, or deliver noisy, but empty thunderbolds like Agarkar. The result is the now familiar rout and dispersal of Indian troops in any encounter with an average or better opposition on battle fields outside the subcontinent. The two factors are clearly linked: The inability to produce high velocity guns results in the inability to produce warriors who can fight when high velocity guns are being fired. As result the Indian army always teeters on the slow lane and panics when the heavy guns go off on the maidan-i-jangs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We shall consider Malhotra’s shyness towards the “H” word and eagerness to work within the system later. In its basic form the U-turn theory states that a Leukospherite (roughly a White man or woman) first whole heartedly delves into the Hindu lore. Then he or she on attaining maturity starts seeing the knowledge gained from the Hindu world in his/her own culture. And the next thing you know they claim that it was always an integral part of their culture and start demonizing the parent Hindu lore and Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hebrew Bible: Tanakh is an acronym of the first Hebrew letter of each of the Masoretic Text&amp;rsquo;s three traditional subdivisions: &amp;ldquo;Written&amp;rdquo; Torah (&amp;lsquo;Teaching&amp;rsquo;, also known as the Five Books of Moses), Nevi&amp;rsquo;im (&amp;lsquo;Prophets&amp;rsquo;) and Ketuvim (&amp;lsquo;Writings&amp;rsquo;)—hence TaNaKh.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;talmūd : primary source of Jewish religious law (halakha) and Jewish theology.

Hindus converting to Islam were exempted from specific taxes. Special attention was given to the education of Muslim children. Towards the end of his reign Muslims made up a very large majority of his senior most nobility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Or consider historian Prof. KS Lal’s works on caste and religion, refuting with primary data the seeming truism, launched by the Communist Party ideologue MN Roy and now omnipresent in the textbooks, that the lowest castes converted en masse to Islam because of its claimed message of equality. Islam mainly won over the urban middle castes (and not because of equality, a value rejected as ingratitude towards the Dispenser of destinies in the Quran, but because of the privileges vis-à-vis non-Muslims), not the Untouchables. Again, the silent treatment has been the only response the “experts” could muster.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278&#34;&gt;KE16&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;parasitic-relation-to-the-other&#34;&gt;Parasitic relation to the other&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A summary from @parikramah:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The sufi Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, a venerated scholar, invited Ahmad Shah Abdali of Afghanistan to attack the Maratha in third battle of Panipat and advised his collaborator Najib al Dawla to launch jehad against Jats. Excerpts:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It has become clear to my mind that the kingdom of heaven has predestined that kafirs should be reduced to a state of humiliation and treated with utter contempt. Should that repository of majesty and dauntless courage (Nizam al-Maluk) gird his loins and direct his attention to such a task he can conquer the world. &amp;hellip; Should he make no effort, they (the Marathas) would inevitably be weakened and annihilated through celestial calamities and in such an event he would gain no credit…As I have learnt this unequivocally (from the divine) I spontaneously write to draw your attention to the great opportunity laid before you. You should therefore not be negligent in fighting jihad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We beseech you in the name of Prophet to fight a jihad against the infidels of this region… The invasion of Nadir shah, who destroyed the Muslims, left the Marathas and Jats secure and prosperous.  This resulted in the infidels regaining their strength and in the reduction of Muslim leaders of Delhi to mere puppets&amp;rdquo; ( Shah Wali Allah and his times by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, page page305).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;…All control of power is with the Hindus because they are the only people who are industrious and adaptable.  Riches and prosperity are theirs, while Muslims have nothing but poverty and misery.  At this juncture you are the only person, who has the initiative, the foresight, the power and capability to defeat the enemy and free the Muslims from the clutches of the infidels.  God forbid if their domination continues, Muslims will even forget Islam and become undistinguishable from the non-Muslims&amp;rdquo; (Dr. Sayed Riaz Ahmad in his book &amp;lsquo;Maulana Maududi and Islamic state&amp;rsquo; - Lahore People&amp;rsquo;s Publishing House, page 15 - 1976).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The findings: about 80% of the criminals at the petty-crime level were Muslims, that figure decreasing when it came to white-collar crime. Please note that under the Indian Penal Code, petty crime includes armed robbery, dacoity and attempted murder - all of which carry heinous penalties by Shariat, which was the point in discussion.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rediff.com/news/sep/05varsha.htm&#34;&gt;RED&lt;/a&gt; 2005 varShA]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;kerala-records&#34;&gt;Kerala records&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Via divodAsa:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from recorded history, the local folklore of Kerala also narrates about Moplah troublemakers. The local legends recorded in Aithihyamala, a popular collection of legends by Kottarathil Shankunni also narrates how the Muslims were troublemakers in the kingdom of Cochin [10]. It narrates the story of Kochi king Rama Varma Shaktan Thampuran on how he executed a Moplah who slaughtered a cow in the kingdom. Another story from same work narrates how Shaktan Thampuran executed a Moplah who tried to sexually assault a Nambuthiri Brahmin lady while her husband was away [11] and also talks about punishment given by Shaktan Thampuran to Moplah thieves who pillaged the travellers [12].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;III. ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HINDUS IN TEXTBOOKS:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: The key role in submitting corrections related to Hinduism in CA Textbooks was played by &lt;strong&gt;The Hindu American Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;The Vedic Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;. In the past, &lt;strong&gt;India in Classrooms&lt;/strong&gt; has also initiated grassroots efforts on Bay Area schools to end stereotyping of Hinduism in schools. In the present controversy, &lt;strong&gt;The Hindu American Foundation&lt;/strong&gt; initiated the first lawsuit against the State of CA in CA State courts. Soon thereafter, second generation Hindu American parents filed a separate lawsuit against the State of California in the Federal Courts, after forming an organization named &lt;strong&gt;CAPEEM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An overwhelming majority of muslims declared their unwillingness to live in a hindu majority democracy and ushered in the partition. Alas, a significant fraction of them stayed back anyway to form an inimical fifth column sympathetic to Pakistan.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the 1946 provincial assembly elections, the Muslim League captured 4.5 million of about 6 million Muslim votes. So, 75% of Indian Muslims voted for the Muslim League and its demand for Pakistan. (One can probably even dig up district-wise statistics. I recall it was 90% of UP, Delhi.) But 75% of Indian muslims in various regions did not go to pAkistan despite voting for it. Though a small &amp;ldquo;elite&amp;rdquo; fraction of the adult population were eligible to vote - one can hardly say that this sample was not representative of the rest of the muslim population.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../../../../images/snippets/muslim-seats-1946.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../../images/snippets/muslim-seats-1946.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;../../../../../images/snippets/muslim-seats-1946.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This can happen as government policy or as a matter of riots.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Summary: Muhammad&amp;rsquo;s example as *the ideal muslim* has motivated murderers and pillagers throughout the ages, including in my country. Like early christians who burnt down the library of Alexandria, they destroyed the great universities of naLandA and vikramashIlA, the temples they razed are too numerous to count - zarathruShTa&amp;rsquo;s favorite tree, the sphynxes nose, tombs of Timbuktu, buddha-s of bAmiyAn being well known examples in the wider world.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;iconoclasm&#34;&gt;Iconoclasm&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;limited-digestion-of-polytheism-and-icon-worship&#34;&gt;Limited digestion of polytheism and icon worship&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sufi and shia dargah-s provide for some limited outlet for polytheistic and iconophilic tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He said a particular thing becomes mandatory for M in reaction to any initiative that dilutes the full limits of Sharia. Therefore, he argued, since some want M to give up cow slaughter and use other animals since Sharia allows it, while it is normally fine, but because it “limits” the practice to reduced allowance of full Sharia, it becomes mandatory for Muslims to react by slaughtering cows only. Normally it would have been permissible but in reaction, it is mandatory.&amp;rdquo;  {&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Gxw6okCPURA?t=678&#34;&gt;YT&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

This is unreported or under-reported in the national or tamil news media till date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ayodhya-mandapam-attacked-with-petrol-and-acid-bombs&#34;&gt;Ayodhya Mandapam attacked with Petrol and Acid bombs.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sri Ram Samaj also known as Ayodhya Mandapam is a well known Ram temple and religious centre in the heart of Chennai in West Mambalam. Around 330PM on Dec 8th around 15 dravidian activists allegedly descended on the temple in two autorickshaws with deadly weapons and shouted “Dont spare anyone who wears sacred thread, or marks on their head Tilak or Vibhuti, thrash them” at passers by. Then they proceeded to attack the temple. First they threw an acid bomb into the temple complex, the acid struck a screen which caught fire. When devotees rushed to douse the flames, the activists hurled a petrol bomb on the idol outside the temple and another inside the temple. They shouted this was in revenge for the damage caused to the EVR Periyar statue kept outside the world famous Sri Ranganath Swamy temple in Srirangam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Important thread : Why opposition to an anti-ISIS movie? B&amp;rsquo;coz many do not want common Indians to remember how a brutal, bloodthirsty, slave owning, genocidal terror organisation enjoys wide support in men and women globally. Just look at these samples&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When ISIS was defeated, many of the women who went there were already dead. Some died fighting, some became suicide bombers, some were killed in airstrikes and some killed brutally by ISIS fighters for refusing to provide sex or trying to escape. Still 67000+ women and children remained. Yes, 67000! They came from all over the world. Atleast 81 countries. Most of them were perfectly happy with Kafirs slaughtered &amp;amp; raped as per Islamist beliefs. Most have not showed remorse even for the sake of returning to their countries. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled 1/4&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shinzo Abe’s Assassin and Japan’s Complicated Spirituality&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The country’s so-called new religions have caused a disproportionate amount of turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By Hiroko Yoda&lt;br&gt;&#xA;July 26, 2022&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Portrait of Shinzo Abe seen during ceremony at the Japan Embassy in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Japan is not widely known for religious extremism or gun violence, and yet Abe’s association with the Unification Church was his murderer’s apparent motive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The killing of the former Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, on July 8th, sent shock waves rippling across Japan and the globe. Even after stepping down as Prime Minister, in the summer of 2020, owing to health issues, Abe was that rarest of presences on the Japanese political scene: an internationally recognizable face, even a celebrity. His hawkish brand of conservatism divided Japan and infuriated many leaders in the region, but endeared him to others, most famously Donald Trump. And, as the single longest-serving prime minister in Japan’s history, he remained, in many ways, the country’s face to the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this narrative, Jesus is in an assembly with his disciples. A mob brings a woman to the assembly, accuses her of having committed adultery, and prepares to stone her to death in accordance with the biblical law (Leviticus 20:10, Deuteronomy 22:22). In our own time, Pope Francis claims that the mob had even bound her hands although the Bible doesn’t mention that. Perhaps, god revealed this additional information to the pope in a private missive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LOPSIDED VIEW&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Published in The Times of India (Bangalore Ed., dt. 11 March 2006)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With reference to &amp;ldquo;They cannot Decide on History (March 9), Romila Thapar and Michael Wetzel are correct only in saying that religions should be taught by parents, pastors and priests. But, that is not true in the US. Here, world cultures within which religions do play a major role are discussed in classrooms. Hindu legends are always referred to as myths whereas stories from the Bible or Quran are not. Despite Sundays in the US being the most segregated day of the week, where whites and blacks continue to worship separately in their churches, the history of US racism is taught as an aberration of the past remedied by its laws and regulations. However, such concessions of interpretaions are not accorded to India&amp;rsquo;s own legal and social attempts to eradicate its caste system. It is indeed unfair to have Thapar and Witzel present such a lopsided view of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The pro-Khalistani preacher took over the organisation after Sidhu’s demise in an accident on February 15, 2022. Sidhu formed ‘Waris Punjab De’ in September 2021 with the aim to “protect the rights of Punjab and raise social issues”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;priesthood-and-protestant-background&#34;&gt;Priesthood and Protestant background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In this article, we propose that both the idea of religious degeneration and the role played by the priests in this process are derived from deep seated Christian conceptions of religion. On the one hand, the biblical story of a god-given religion that was subsequently corrupted through the course of time was the general framework that structured the history of Christianity and of all the other so-called religions. On the other hand, because Christianity assigned a primary role to the clergy, religion was an affair of the priests only. Consequently, the mechanism of degeneration had to be found in the priesthood: priests became the instruments of the devil and began to transform the original god-given religion. This understanding of religion, we would like to suggest, structured the European quest for the religious elsewhere. Brahmins were identified as &amp;lsquo;priests&amp;rsquo;, who created &amp;lsquo;brahmanism&amp;rsquo;, which was imposed upon Indian society. One of the main elements of this sacerdotal religion that preserved their privileges was the caste system. This conception, we would further like to emphasise, became more poignant, more structured and more coherent against the background of the &lt;strong&gt;reformation and the Protestant critiques of the Roman-Catholic church&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;proselytism&#34;&gt;Proselytism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not only did Jews of this time engage in proselytizing, the very word “proselyte” is thought to have been originally coined (proselythos in Greek) to refer to a convert who had turned away from the polytheistic traditions of the Greeks, Romans, etc, and embraced Judaism. According to A History of the Jewish People, the “roots” of the proselytizing movement among Jews “reached back to the beginnings of the Second Temple Era”, that is, the late 6th century BC, and this movement “reached it’s peak in the first century CE” [p. 276]. &amp;quot; {&lt;a href=&#34;https://egregores.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/constantine-a-brief-history-of-revolutionary-monotheism-part-three/&#34;&gt;EG&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the worst rascals among other peoples,15 renouncing their ancestral religions, always kept sending tribute and contributions to Jerusalem, thereby increasing the wealth of the Jews; again, the Jews are extremely loyal toward one another, and always ready to show compassion, but toward every other people they p183feel only hate and enmity. &amp;hellip; Those who are converted to their ways follow the same practice, and the earliest lesson they receive is to despise the gods, to disown their country, and to regard their parents, children, and brothers as of little account.  However, they take thought to increase their numbers; for they regard it as a crime to kill any late-born child&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; - Tacitus [&lt;a href=&#34;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Histories/5A*.html&#34;&gt;T1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wars&#34;&gt;Wars&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Simon Maccabaeus and his son John Hyrcanus, who reigned as rulers of Judea for almost four decades (142-104 BC)&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Gezer was invested according to all the rules of that art and attacked with the sophisticated siege engines that were in use in the hellenistic armies. The population was expelled, pagan cults abolished and the city resettled with Jews faithful to their religion. Simon also built himself a palace in Gezer, which became one of the administrative centres of Judea. John Hyrcanus, Simon’s son, was appointed governor of the city. An even greater impression on contemporaries was made by the conquest of the Acra, for as long as the citadel was inhabited by hellenists and garrisoned by gentiles Judea’s independence could not be assured.&amp;rdquo; [A History of the Jewish People, Ben-Sasson &amp;amp; Malamat, p. 215]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In principle, John’s position was the same as that previously formulated by Simon in his reply to the envoys of Antiochus Sidetes — that the whole of Palestine was the ancestral heritage of the Jewish nation. In that heritage there was no room for foreign cults, as evidenced by the conversion of Idumea and the destruction of the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim. Under John Hyrcanus territorial expansion proceeded in various directions — south, north and east — with decisive consequences for the history of the people and the land&amp;hellip;  Now they completed the conquest of Galilee and defeated the Itureans, who seem to have ruled over part of the Upper Galilee. Like the Idumeans before them and in line with the policy developed by John Hyrcanus, they were converted …&amp;rdquo;  [A History of the Jewish People, Ben-Sasson &amp;amp; Malamat, p. 218-9]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even after Roman conquest and liberation of pagans: &amp;ldquo;for many years to come the Jewish population of Palestine was to exceed the gentiles in strength and numbers. The absorption of the gentile population, excluding the hellenized cities and the Samaritan concentration around Mount Gerizim, as a result of the proselytizing policy of John Hyrcanus and his successors, was irreversible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not surprisingly, the considerable interest shown by their flock in the Greek religion greatly alarmed the monotheistic paleo-Abrahamist orthodoxy and prophets who constantly strove to get them back. For example, the paleo-Abrahamists greatly praise one of their warrior-priests Mattathias who began the holy war against the Greeks. But the first person he murdered was a fellow paleo-Abrahamist because he had made offerings to Zeus at the altar. Only thereafter he kills the Greek official who was guarding the altar.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/a-greco-semitic-apollonian-ritual-and-the-heathen-assimilation-of-paleo-abrahamism/&#34;&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mattathias’ son Judah Maccabee who continued holy war also rounded up several fellow paleo-Abrahamists, who were worshiping Greek deities, and forcibly clipped off their foreskins. But once the Hasmonean clan of Mattathias and Judah came to power, what happened was a civil war in Israel between the orthodox and their cousins who followed Hellenistic traditions to different degrees. Thus, it appears the success of the Paleo-Abrahamistic orthodoxy in keep their flock de-paganized was not great. &amp;hellip; &amp;quot; &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/a-greco-semitic-apollonian-ritual-and-the-heathen-assimilation-of-paleo-abrahamism/&#34;&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) originated in Roman and Jewish religious tensions (?), and later escalated due to anti-taxation protests and attacks upon Roman citizens..&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Kitos War (115–117) before being crushed by Quietus (Kitos): widespread slaughter of left-behind Roman garrisons and Roman citizens by Jewish rebels. In Cyrenaica (Libia), the rebels were led by one Lukuas or Andreas. His group destroyed many temples, including those to Hecate, Jupiter, Apollo, Artemis, and Isis, as well as the civil structures that were symbols of Rome, including the Caesareum, the basilica, and the public baths. Lukuas led the rebels toward Alexandria, entered the city, which had been abandoned by the Roman governor, Marcus Rutilius Lupus, and set fire to it. The Egyptian temples and the tomb of Pompey were destroyed. This resulted in great depopulation and the need to establish new colonies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE) triggered by building Aelia Capitolina, over the ruins of Jerusalem and the erection of a temple to Jupiter on the Temple Mount. Simon bar Kokhba, the commander of the revolt, was regarded by many Jews as the Messiah, who would restore their national independence. Result: Suppression of Jewish religious and political autonomy by Hadrian (no circumcision allowed), Large-scale destruction of Judean population by Roman troops.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jewish leaders and population - to this day - regard the Bar Kokhba assault with reverence and fondness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;iconoclasm&#34;&gt;Iconoclasm&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Josiah destroyed all the shrines in Judah outside of Jerusalem. Burned the &amp;ldquo;Asherah&amp;rdquo; in the temple and scattered the ashes in a graveyard. He also went up to Bethel(an important Israelite temple). Josiah destroyed Bethel, defiled it by killing priests on the altar and burning their corpses on it. Bethel, that means &amp;ldquo;house of god&amp;rdquo;, that was supposedly founded by Jacob and had its sacred stone pillar set up by him. The rulers and priests aggressively promoted Jerusalem, until they finally decided that it was to have the only temple.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since we have never seen this happen, there must be some divine prohibition against it.&amp;rdquo; This is an astounding example from medieval times by a Christian theologian who invokes God not to create living things but to prevent them from naturally getting created.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The chruch famously opposed novel scientific ideas of Copernicus and Galelio (whom it forced to recant). We have also seen a 100 year long rejection of the principle of natural selection. Some even opposed the printing press (&lt;a href=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/HwXHBXK.jpg&#34;&gt;IMG&lt;/a&gt;) and mathematics (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pickover/status/769911258699145216&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;)!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a view that the Christian doctrine of causation (especially the separation of primary and secondary causes) helped the birth of modern science. Only a few phenomena, like Jesus&amp;rsquo; resurrection and the initial moment of creation were thought to be directly caused by God (primary causation). Every thing else was caused by secondary (naturalistic) causes which did not require God&amp;rsquo;s constant intervention. God sets creation in motion and then the intrinsic natures of things carry the process forward.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To find out which phenomena are caused directly by God (miracles), it becomes important to understand what the &amp;ldquo;common course of nature&amp;rdquo; is. Only then can deviations from that common course be detected. An investigation into the common course of nature for the discernment of miracles contributed to the development of modern science.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;current-status&#34;&gt;Current status&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Catholic church&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Accepts the theory of evolution and the big bang theory since around 1950-s. (Francis &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120025/pope-francis-quotes-evolution-big-bang-are-nothing-celebrate&#34;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt;) Main question is when God managed to insert a soul into humans.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Miscellaneous American creationists&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reject big bang, the theory of evolution, even human induced global warming as of 2014.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;secularism-sacred-vs-profane-distinction&#34;&gt;Secularism, Sacred vs profane distinction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts on this are &lt;a href=&#34;../../../self-cultivation/rituals/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brahmins were a favorite target of Khalistani activists. Bhindranwale&amp;rsquo;s rhetoric frequently centred on anti Brahmanism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On 25th June 1983, a Pujari of a temple in Sultanpur was kiIIed with a sharp knife. While attacks on Hindu places of worship have abated in Punjab, thanks to the anti militancy drives of police and army, they are not completely a thing of past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a Hindu priest was warned and shot.  He passed away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Malhotra cites numerous examples to support this theory, dating from the erasure of Upanishadic and Vijnanavada Buddhist influences on Plotinus to the modern day reimportation of Christian yoga into India.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Other pagan cultures&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Egypt - Isis cult &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/887525452960714753&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ayurvedic medicine&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yoga&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/CarolHortonBooks/posts/923146944391426?comment_id=923208227718631&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;total_comments=21&amp;amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D&#34;&gt;FB-CH15&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;ldquo;Understanding that the roots, tradition and evolution of yoga dharma are from India and are a Hindu construct both in practice and theory&amp;hellip;practically and philosophically, is not a manner of ego or ownership. It&amp;rsquo;s not about taking away the freedom for new yogis to do whatever they want to do with it, even if it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely profane, mundane or adharmic; and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not about taking away anyone&amp;rsquo;s livelihood. It is about recognizing the cultural, spiritual and religious contexts and history of the practice, and recognizing that without theory or philosophy, practice becomes superficial and loses it&amp;rsquo;s taste. It&amp;rsquo;s also about transparency, honesty and integrity. So let&amp;rsquo;s be real&amp;hellip;literally real! A tree without roots doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand for very long. If yoga is a practice of cosmic as well as terrestrial truths, it will evolve in like to the way it already has in India and her cultural realm over millennia. The future of yoga in the West will mirror what it has become already in the East. You can buy some Georgia peaches and fly them to Alaska, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make them Alaskan peaches.

He naturally feels less proud about his own native tradition, and feels more highly about the alien culture.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Erosion of a feeling of gratitude and sympathy towards the culture of origin.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An example observed in the context of debates on Yoga appropriation by Americans: &amp;ldquo;From previous observations, I had gathered that American practitioners were eager to take what they want, make it their &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; and then disparage or work against Indian Hindu concerns, all the while retaining a sense of smug superiority.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From divodAsa:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the fall of Marakkars, the Arakkal Ali Rajas of Kannur followed the same path. Ali Rajas of Arakkal were converts from a line of the Hindu Kolathiri Rajas of north Malabar. There are many folklore associated with them in North Malabar. They gained royal status via association with Kolathiris. But later they betrayed the Hindus of Malabar and began to claim superiority over Hindu kings by allying with Hyder Ali of Mysore [6]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;war&#34;&gt;War&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even from Agatangeghos&amp;rsquo; account it is clear that the triumph of this new force was assured only after a decisive period during which Gregory the Illuminator &amp;ldquo;relied on the King&amp;rsquo;s terror and instruction to secure obedience from all&amp;rdquo; (p443). Preaching meekness and mildness to his flock Gregory the Illuminator and his allies did not consider such virtues appropriate to their own proselytising work. In the Christian conversion force and war clearly played a role immensely more important than the preaching of the priests! The Church evidently cared less about the salvation of souls and more about attaining power and wealth for itself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;iconoclasm-and-wealth-acquisition&#34;&gt;Iconoclasm and wealth acquisition&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;While Gregory the Illuminator is naturally depicted as playing the decisive role, the success of the enterprise was crucially dependent on the Christian alliance with King Drtad and the subsequent deployment of the royal army in the service of the new religion. It was only after cementing this pact that Gregory &amp;ldquo;received sanction from the King, his princes and lords&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;commence the task&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;demolishing, destroying, annihilating and removing from the face of the earth the scandal&amp;rdquo; of paganism. (p437). With &amp;ldquo;peremptory instruction from the King&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;entire royal army&amp;rdquo; proceeded to wage veritable war to &amp;ldquo;annihilate even the memory of these false deities that dared assume the name of god&amp;rdquo;. (p437) The vast scale of this campaign is not only described in detail, but told with a measure of satisfaction too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Christian war opened with the now Christian army marching on the town of Ardashad &amp;ldquo;there to destroy the temple of the goddess Anahid&amp;rdquo; (p437). On its way, in a strategically and ideologically significant move, the army &amp;ldquo;first set about destroying, wrecking and burning&amp;rdquo; the renowned pagan &amp;ldquo;centre of learning and godly wisdom&amp;rdquo; said to have been established by Ormist (p437). Thereafter the tide of devastation and looting raged across the entire land as every possible pagan temple and statue was levelled and its land and wealth appropriated by the victorious Christian Church. &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Christian Church then set about consolidating its newly established supremacy. It first sought to secure a degree of popular acquiescence and support through the distribution of some pagan wealth including much &amp;ldquo;gold and silver&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;the poor, the suffering and the propertyless&amp;rdquo; (p439, 2441). The Church however made sure to retain for itself monopoly control of the source of wealth. It seized all pagan &amp;ldquo;land and buildings along with the resident serfs and (including even) pagan priests&amp;rdquo;, now no doubt transformed into servants of the new religion (p441). Thus it ensured the population&amp;rsquo;s permanent subordination to itself as it emerged as a dominant political and economic power in the land.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

People used to gather outside shops to watch the serial Mahabharata based on the great Hindu epic. The radicals were especially jealous of TV serials Ramayana and Mahabharata as they rejuvenated public interest in Hindu epics. The Khalistani radicals used to bomb. Another day, another set of people watching the TV serial Mahabharata was bombed by Khalistani radicals. 5 kiIIed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;appropriation-of-texts-and-traditions&#34;&gt;Appropriation of texts and traditions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Johannes Bronkhorst: &amp;ldquo;There are no ancient texts that “belong” in any essential sense to the tradition that identifies with it. The Mahabharata “belongs” as little to modern Hindus as the Bible “belongs” to modern Christians. Historical scholarship cannot be steered by modern groups that have appropriated the texts they are studying.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The abrahamist scaffolding may be nearly impossible to completely overcome. Example: Mark Dyzchowski (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Vajrakila/status/706496656942891009&#34;&gt;TW1&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-charge-of-native-neglect&#34;&gt;The charge of native neglect&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aka White-man&amp;rsquo;s burden to &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; Indian/ hindu studies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Plenty of Indians agree that the claim that &amp;ldquo;Value of knowledge by Indians is zero or close to zero.&amp;rdquo; is false. The life of every practicing hindu still places high value on knowledge of traditional hindu knowledge (including performance arts, ritual, music, stories, philosophies).&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sanskrit revitalization is an example of a major grassroots movement in this direction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are plenty of people who attain privately mastery of shAstra and kAvya solely due to their love of those topics and a strong desire to put what they see into practice, not to show how smart they are. These are nourished within private circles centered around local masters in the topic (R Ganesh and his fellow avadhAnin-s jump to mind as an example). This is how it ought to be, and it is healthy. A far cry from the academic knowledge industry. A supposed scholar of kAvya who cannot and has not composed a kAvya is a fraud. Not worth a cent, let alone millions of dollars.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is a continuation of &amp;ldquo;white man&amp;rsquo;s burden&amp;rdquo; that many Indologits wants to provide the opposite impression (that Indians commonly think that the value of such knowledge is close to zero).&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Examples: Sheldon discusses in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3bfxR9Ic0&amp;amp;t=12m00s&#34;&gt;SP12:00&lt;/a&gt; Obviously false, and  Of course, the value as he describes in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3bfxR9Ic0&amp;amp;t=40m00s&#34;&gt;40:00&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3bfxR9Ic0&amp;amp;t=55m00s&#34;&gt;55:00&lt;/a&gt; are quite innately accepted by hindus as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What these aliens consider &amp;ldquo;vitally important&amp;rdquo; (often for the purpose of their livelihood, though hypocritically masked in terms of grander purposes) is not necessarily that important to hindus.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If Indian government and education system does not value such knowledge, it is precisely because of the value system that Sheldon represents - where &amp;ldquo;secularism&amp;rdquo; (a post-christian christian virtue which is meaningless and even poisonous for pagans) and &amp;ldquo;study without practice&amp;rdquo; (the dry end of the dry-scholar/ practitioner/practitioner-scholar spectrum)  reign supreme.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While Indian education system has its problems, there are quite a few Sanskrit universities and institutions, where traditional knowledge systems are still studied.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A farman of Aurangzeb is being cited and it has been also in news in a daily. The farman is geniune and is a best example that shows what a chameleon Aurangzeb was. Let me tell you the truth behind it. The persian farman is published in The Journal and proceedings of the asiatic society of bengal, new series , vol 7 year 1911 on pages 687-90. You can read the original persian (if someone needs to) and also the english translation &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/ia/mobot31753002183827#page/713/mode/1up&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The farman is dated 16 Jamadi us Sani, 1069 Hijri which comes to 28 February 1659 C.E.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Belief in the existence and oneness of God (Allah).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Belief in the existence of Angels.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Belief in the existence of the books of which God is the author: the Quran (revealed to Muhammad), the Gospel (revealed to Jesus), the Torah (revealed to Moses), and Psalms to David.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Belief in the existence of all Prophets: Muhammad being the last of them, Jesus the penultimate, and Moses sent before them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Belief in the existence of the Day of Judgment: in that day, humanity will be divided into two groups: that of paradise and that of hell. These groups are themselves composed of subgroups.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Belief in the existence of God&amp;rsquo;s predestination, whether it involves good or bad.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ahmedis-and-prophet&#34;&gt;Ahmedis and prophet&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ahmadis give a spin to the concept khatm-i-nabiyeen. Contrary to the popular meaning, ie mohammed being chronologically last in the line of prophets, they say “khatm” means “perfection” not “last”, thus while Muhammad is the best prophet, there is scope for others after him. - ST&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The pop history version(from Christians and Hollywood) would have you think that non-Jewish/Christian society was a big free-love clusterfuck. I am tired of seeing this ignorance. So to shine a light on the issue, I figured why not go over the Biblical and historical Christian mores, just a bit. Many people mistake modern Western mores for being &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo;. This is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1623 the vexed subject of Hindu questions was finally disposed of by Pope Gregory XV, who issued a Constitution, according to which Brahmans were, after their conversion to Christianity, allowed to retain their sacred thread, the use of ablutions and of Sandal, on the condition however that the thread should not be given to such Brahmans by their own priests in their temples, with their prayers, rites, or sacrifices, but simply by a Catholic priest; that the string composed of three threads should be worn by converted Brahmans in honour of the Christian Trinity and as a sign of their nobility, and that at the same time the converted Hindus of noble descent, should not despise those who are born of low estate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brébeuf—the tall, pale stranger from the land across the sea—was invited to witness the sacred Wyandot Feast of the Dead. In the ceremony, held at the Wyandot capital of Ossossané, the Wyandot dead were disinterred, reverently cleaned, and placed together in a communal ossuary pit, along with valuable and meaningful material offerings. The Christian priest was greatly impressed by the pagans’ treatment of their dead, and it is perhaps not coincidence that this was the year of Brébeuf’s first great missionary successes.&#xA;&amp;hellip; Whatever good was present at the Ossossané ossuary—where those who had not yet encountered the fullness of Truth honored their dead as best they knew how—is increased a thousandfold in the cemeteries of the residential schools, where baptized Christians were given Christian burials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amir Mahmud in his work Habib al-Siyar writes that after the battle of Merv, the body of Shaybani Khan was found under a pile of slain Uzbeks, having died of suffocation. The qizilbashs severed his head and then cannibalized him in an act of devotion towards Shah Isma&amp;rsquo;il. Shah Isma&amp;rsquo;il latter turned Shaybani Khan&amp;rsquo;s skull into a jewelled drinking goblet—an old tradition of the steppe nomads, from the times of Xiongnu—and gifted it to Babur while sending his other body parts all over the empire to be put on display.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Ever wondered why?  Read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By 16th c. the Church became very powerful &amp;amp; dominant. Thereby corrupt. It had immense political &amp;amp; spiritual power over the Roman empire and the emperor. It made salvation a business enterprise. It began selling INDULGENCES saying ppl&amp;rsquo;s punishment for sins could be reduced. What are INDULGENCES? Catholic Christianity of that time taught that sin was of 2 types: Mortal sin which directly earned hell after death &amp;amp; Venal sin which was a few years of purification in purgatory - an interim state between life on earth &amp;amp; eternal life in heaven. It was promoted widely that purchasing Indulgences could reduce time in the purgatory. Priests, aristocrats, entrepreneurs who wanted money for their projects would hire salesmen (pardoners/quaestors) to sell indulgences. Corrupt salesmen soon started promising salvation itself. The quaestors forced ppl to buy indulgences from them. They threatened eternal damnation to those who refused to buy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

By that standard, most papers contain plagiarism; but what passes unnoticed elsewhere becomes a scandal when done by a self-identifying Hindu. Yet, numerous Indologists started a holier-than-thou tirade against the “plagiarism”, a comical drama to watch. Malhotra then walked the extra mile writing Nicholson out of his narrative and quoting original sources instead (thereby incidentally showing the amount of plagiarism that Nicholson himself had committed, though no Indologist ever remarked on that). But this inconvenient development was given the silent treatment, and Truschke still presupposes that there ever was a substantive “plagiarism” case against Malhotra, and by extension against the whole “Hindu Right”. &amp;hellip; By contrast, Malhotra, by personalizing his argument into specific dissections of the work of leading scholars such as Wendy Doniger, Sheldon Pollock or Anantanand Rambachan, has earned a session at the annual conference of the trend-setting American Academy of Religion. On Indological discussion forums, his input is frequently mentioned, though the academics mostly keep up their airs of pooh-poohing that interloper, in a bid to justify their ignoring his actual critique of their own work.&amp;rdquo;  [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278&#34;&gt;KE16&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Petition against the books was started by Jesse Knuston, a Sanskrit professor and collaborator with Sheldon Pollock [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/harper-collins-india-in-view-of-the-widespread-plagiarism-found-in-rajiv-malhotra-s-book-indra-s-net-published-by-harper-collins-india-we-call-on-the-publisher-to-make-a-formal-public-apology-and-to-withdraw-the-book-from-the-market?recruiter=5167386&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_facebook_responsive&amp;amp;utm_term=des-lg-no_src-custom_msg&amp;amp;fb_ref=Default&#34;&gt;C15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.niticentral.com/2015/07/15/rajiv-malhotra-on-hindu-intellectuals-niti-exclusive-323900.html&#34;&gt;N&lt;/a&gt;], with inputs from Richard Fox Young, (Christian seminary professor and collaborator with John Dayal) and  Ananya Vajpeyi.

In 2014, I read a paper on the Rg-Vedic seer Vasishtha and his relative divinization in a panel on “divinization” at the European Conference for South Asia Studies in Zürich. My paper was enthusiastically received, also by the panel’s organizers when I sent in the final version for publication. First, they accepted it, but then, I received an embarrassed e-mail from the organizers stating that they could not include my paper, without any reason given. Upon my enquiring, the half-line reply said that it did not fit their project. In all its insignificance, this still managed to be a blatant lie, and their earlier acceptance confirmed that this could not have been the reason.

Do good to your neighbours. 2. Forgive your enemies. 3. Spread my message all over.&amp;rdquo;, we have noted that Christianity is far more sinister.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;mother-teresa-the-angel-from-hell&#34;&gt;Mother Teresa, the angel from hell&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Christopher Hitchens &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;MT was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a gift from God. &amp;hellip; Many more people are poor and sick because of the life of MT: Even more will be poor and sick if her example is followed. She was a fanatic, a fundamentalist, and a fraud, and a church that officially protects those who violate the innocent has given us another clear sign of where it truly stands on moral and ethical questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Regarding the abysmal quality of care for her poor patients, we have plenty of testimony from disillusioned volunteers. [CH&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65JxnUW7Wk4#t=382&#34;&gt;documentary shot&lt;/a&gt;.] Mother Teresa herself referred to the facilities as &amp;ldquo;Houses of the Dying&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2894%2991759-0/fulltext&#34;&gt;Lancet published&lt;/a&gt; a critical account of the care in Mother Teresa&amp;rsquo;s facilities in 1994. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nouvelles.umontreal.ca/udem-news/news/20130301-mother-teresa-anything-but-a-saint.html&#34;&gt;An academic Canadian study&lt;/a&gt; from a couple of years ago found fault with &amp;ldquo;her rather dubious way of caring for the sick etc..&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Baptisms of the dying: In a speech at the Scripps Clinic in California in January 1992, she said: &amp;ldquo;Something very beautiful&amp;hellip; not one has died without receiving the special ticket for St. Peter, as we call it. We call baptism ticket for St. Peter. We ask the person, do you want a blessing by which your sins will be forgiven and you receive God? They have never refused. So 29,000 have died in that one house [in Kalighat] from the time we began in 1952.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As a general liar: &lt;a href=&#34;http://indiafacts.co.in/expose-mother-teresas-deceptions-demagoguery/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;rome&#34;&gt;Rome&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Julian to Arsacius, High-priest of Galatia (362, on his way to Antioch in June?]&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The Hellenic religion does not yet prosper as I desire, and it is the fault of those who profess it; for the worship of the gods is on a splendid and magnificent scale, surpassing every prayer and every hope. May Adrasteia pardon my words, for indeed no one, a little while ago, would have ventured even to pray for a change of such a sort or so complete within so short a time. Why, then, do we think that this is enough, why do we not observe that it is their benevolence to strangers, their care for the graves of the dead and the pretended holiness of their lives that have done most to increase atheism? I believe that we ought really and truly to practise every one of these virtues. And it is not enough for you alone to practise them, but so must all the priests in Galatia, without exception. Either shame or persuade them into righteousness or else remove them from their priestly office, if they do not, together with their wives, children and servants, attend the worship of the gods but allow their servants or sons or wives to show impiety towards the gods and honour atheism more than piety. In the second place, admonish them that no priest may enter a theatre or drink in a tavern or control any craft or trade that is base and not respectable. Honour those who obey you, but those who disobey, expel from office. In every city establish frequent hostels in order that strangers may profit by our benevolence: I do not mean for our own people only, but for others also who are in need of money. I have but now made a plan by which you may be well provided for this; for I have given directions that 30,000 modii of corn shall be assigned every year for the whole of Galatia, and 60,000 pints of wine. I order that one-fifth of this be used for the poor who serve the priests, and the remainder be distributed by us to strangers and beggars. For it is disgraceful that, when no Jew ever has to beg, and the impious Galilaeans support not only their own poor but ours as well, all men see that our people lack aid from us. Teach those of the Hellenic faith to contribute to public service of this sort, and the Hellenic villages to offer their first fruits to the gods, and accustom those who love the Hellenic religion to these good works by teaching them that this was our practice of old. At any rate Homer makes Eumaeus say: &amp;ldquo;Stranger, it is not lawful for me, not even though a baser man than you should come, to dishonour a stranger. For from Zeus come all strangers and beggars. And a gift, though small, is precious.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m the Chair of the Moses Lectureship Committee. [[0:54]] We and the Graduate Division are pleased to present Yuri Slezkine the fall speaker [[0:59]] in the Bernard Moses Memorial Lecture series. In 1937, University of California President, [[1:06]] Robert Gordon Sproul and the UC Board of Regents established the Bernard Moses Memorial Lectureship [[1:12]] in the Social Sciences. The lectureship honors the memory of the late Bernard Moses, a professor of history [[1:19]] and political science at the University of California from 1875 to 1911 and an emeritus professor [[1:26]] from 1911 until his death in 1930. Professor Moses earned a worldwide reputation [[1:32]] as a pioneer scholar, especially for his contributions to understanding the historical origins of the problems [[1:38]] of the Latin American republics. Professor Moses was also an expert on Philippine history [[1:44]] and he served as a member of the United States Philippine Commission from 1900 to 1904. [[1:51]] Past lecturers have included Herma Hill Kay, Nicholas Riasanovsky, George Lakoff, Kenneth Stampp, [[1:58]] Ken Jowitt, Reinhard Bendix, Robert Scalapino, John Rowe, Woodrow Borah, Carolyn Merchant, [[2:06]] Jean Lave, Emmanuel Saez, Mary Ann Mason and Aihwa Ong. [[2:13]] And now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to say a few words about our lecturer today, Yuri Slezkine. [[2:18]] Appointed the Jane K. Sather Professor of History in 2009, Professor Slezkine has been a member of the UC Berkeley [[2:25]] Department of History since 1992. His numerous and wide-ranging publications [[2:31]] have focused on ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union as well as, Soviet historiography, ethnography [[2:37]] and ethnogenetics. Winner of the 2005 National Jewish Book Award, [[2:43]] among several other prizes, Slezkine&amp;rsquo;s groundbreaking book &amp;ldquo;The Jewish Century&amp;rdquo; [[2:48]] has been translated into seven languages and remains both widely respected and controversial. [[2:55]] Earlier publications include; &amp;ldquo;Arctic Mirrors: Russia and the Small People of the North&amp;rdquo;, [[3:00]] &amp;ldquo;Between Heaven and Hell: the Myth of Siberia in Russian Culture&amp;rdquo; as a co-editor, the article &amp;ldquo;The USSR as a Communal Apartment [[3:09]] or How a Socialist State Promoted Ethnic Particularism&amp;rdquo; and a co-edited volume with Sheila Fitzpatrick [[3:15]] called &amp;ldquo;In the Shadow of Revolution: Life Stories of Russian Women From 1917 to the Second World War&amp;rdquo;. [[3:22]] Professor Slezkine earned his Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Russian Language and Literature from the University of Moscow in 1978. [[3:29]] Departing the USSR in the late 1970s, he worked as a translator in Mozambique and Portugal [[3:35]] before moving to the United States where he was awarded his doctoral degree in History at the University of Texas at Austin in 1989. [[3:43]] Slezkine has been awarded fellowships from Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin, [[3:50]] the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Hoover Institution and the Guggenheim Foundation. [[3:55]] He&amp;rsquo;s also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. All these honors are testament to the innovation [[4:01]] and creativity of his scholarship. Professor Slezkine&amp;rsquo;s lecture today to quote from the enticing blurb that drew you all here, [[4:09]] explores the private lives of Bolshevik government officials along with their wives, maids, [[4:16]] lovers, children and comrades. Revolutions, Slezkine tells us, devour their parents. [[4:24]] They begin as tragedy and end at home. By framing the Bolshevik Revolution as a family drama, [[4:30]] Slezkine reimagines the story of the Bolsheviks rise. Please join me in welcoming my friend, [[4:37]] Professor Yuri Slezkine.

Once you realise this, it makes more sense. Let&amp;rsquo;s dip into that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Islamic tradition claims Mohammed battled polytheistic pagan idol-worshippers. That&amp;rsquo;s likely fiction. Historically, Mohammed vied with Jews and Christians, which is why the Quran talks about their beliefs so much, whereas it doesn&amp;rsquo;t delve into supposed &amp;ldquo;Meccan&amp;rdquo; paganism. To run his scam, and persuade Jews and Christians to follow his new religion instead of their existing ones, Mohammed had to depict both Judaism and Christianity as flawed, and Islam as a celestial correction Allah had sent down for humanity to follow. He did this via Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Albert Hall, London&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this moment of crisis for Baldwin, a by-election was taking place in St. George’s, Westminster. At one point Baldwin considered resigning his seat and standing as a candidate, but in the event the pro-Baldwin banner was carried by Duff Cooper against an anti-Baldwin candidate vigorously supported by Beaverbrook and Rothermere. The impact of this meeting at the Albert Hall just outside the constituency was overshadowed by Baldwin’s attack the same evening on the “Press Lords,” whom he condemned as seeking “power without responsibility the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages”. The phrase came from Baldwin’s cousin, Rudyard Kipling. It was devastating. Duff Cooper won easily and Baldwin’s leadership was preserved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Banu Quraiza massacre) are abstract concepts, as are Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Juno and the emperor Julian. The Aurangzebs, Mahmuds and Aladins (ie their early Christian equivalents) of Europe are about as abstract as the forgotten Roman Gods. Not so for us culturally rooted Hindus. IshAna still lives in our rage, Indra in our stength, Earth in our body and so on. I only need to travel 150 kilometers from my hometown to see temples rendered to ruins by the eununch ghAzi mallik kafur, not too much farther are Hampi and Srirangam.

Starting from 1956, the US government under Title Sixth of the Higher Education Act funds 125 university-based area studies units. UC Berkeley’s South Asia area studies program, for instance, receives $3.5 million/year. In its Cold War form, area studies was intended as an extension of the US foreign policy and the work of both the CIA and the State Department—this is not a conspiracy theory, but commonly acknowledged and debated among scholars themselves. Much of the study of India’s history, religion and present society takes place within South Asia area studies, with its legacy focus on politics, economics, social injustice and conflict.&amp;rdquo; - arumuganAthasvAmin.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;pro-liberal-bias&#34;&gt;Pro-liberal bias&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Johannes Bronkhorst: &amp;ldquo;We should take care not to present ourselves as mere good-will ambassadors of another tradition, providing entertainment to those thus inclined.

This did not begin with vijaya-nAma-vyApArin becoming the mahAmlechCharAT.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recent Euro-American academe has bred a certain common type among those of European/Euro-West Asian ancestry that loves to conform. We psychoanalyze this as primarily stemming from their non-reversal to a natural religion after their faith in a West Asian counter-religion weakened. Thus, they need things to believe in &amp;amp; feel part of a tradition larger than themselves. navyonmAda satisfies that but there is also an urge to feel heroic in the fight against the shaitan &amp;ndash; probably stemming from the vAsana-s of the counter-religions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what &amp;ldquo;ground work&amp;rdquo; these 2 sanghis have done but they seem to have no touch with reality &amp;amp; repeating talking pts they get in their bauddhik sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been through almost every call recording &amp;amp; video interviews of ex pretas by Shivashakti, reasons for preta success mentioned are family problems like disease,&#xA;alcoholism, &amp;amp; finances sometimes. Usually disease or some other family problem are mentioned. Not even SC callers have mentioned jati discrimination as the reason+++(5)+++. That&amp;rsquo;s what u get when u do actual ground work like Shivashakti.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;definition-in-opposition&#34;&gt;Definition in opposition&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A counter religion is defined in &lt;em&gt;opposition&lt;/em&gt; to another, pre-existing natural religion (though they may falsely claim to be the &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo;). This opposition is a core part of a counter religion, and not incidental.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we have the first two of the 10 commandments, combined with universalism - &amp;ldquo;You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make for yourself a carved image.&amp;rdquo;; implying the existance of &amp;ldquo;False Gods&amp;rdquo;. Similarly, in a later evolute we have - &amp;ldquo;Mohammed is the last prophet, and he supersedes all predecessors&amp;rdquo;. Hence, such religions are said to be &lt;em&gt;defined&lt;/em&gt; in opposition to others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What makes a woke theory &amp;ldquo;Critical?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding what the woke mean when they use the term &amp;ldquo;critical,&amp;rdquo; and how that differs from the enlightenment liberal notion of &amp;ldquo;critical thinking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there was a single word that summed up the thinking at the heart of Critical Social Justice (AKA wokeness) it is the word ‘critical.’ In the academic world Critical Social Justice Theorists have come up with a great number of theories which they call critical: Critical Pedagogy, Critical Race Theory, Critical Queer Theory, Critical Race Pedagogy, Critical Dietetics, Critical Legal Studies, and so on. All of these are “Critical Theories,” and all of these are explicitly concerned with what is commonly called wokeness, or, in the words of Özlem Sensoy and Robin DiAngelo, Critical Social Justice &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (there’s that word ‘critical’ again).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cult substructure</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/rivals/academia/articles/MT/cult-substructure/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hindutva.github.io/rivals/academia/articles/MT/cult-substructure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To expand: There are few points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Euro-American academia has a bit of a cult-like structure to it, i.e., there are certain beliefs that most of its practitioners don&amp;rsquo;t challenge. For e.g., at the highest level the peer-review/journal publication/impact factor fetish. Thus, practices which are harmful to the field or simply unethical (sophisticated plagiarism &amp;amp; fake result production) are rampant. The degree varies from field to field &amp;amp; has some correlation with how ethnically diverse it is. A field which is dominated by people of Western Euro&#xA;ancestry, with few non-Euro ancestry folks tends to be more susceptible for certain cult nostrums taking root. For e.g.,paleontology is predominantly peopled by such folk; thus, even though it is rather close to the foundations of biology, it is overrun by the fads of navyonmAda &amp;amp; many of its younger practitioners believe in contra-biological constructions of that unmAda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Both ideologies share a common agenda and end goals for what they aim to achieve, but their methods and approaches differ. Ultimately, neither is beneficial for India.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dravidam carries a significant amount of historical baggage. It sees Periyar as its ideological father, whose many controversial statements remain unacceptable to the common man. Despite holding power for decades, Dravidam has failed to achieve its original objectives. While the political parties associated with it may have benefited from their time in power, the broader ideological goals with which the movement began remain unfulfilled. Recognizing this failure, Dravidam seeks to evolve, refine, and rebrand itself to shed the negative baggage it has accumulated over the past century. This attempt at reinvention has given rise to Tamil Desiyam, which is a modernized version of Dravidam’s ideology, repackaged to appeal to the present-day audience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Augustine believed that all unbaptised infants were damned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;St. Gregory, the pope, also spelled out this doctrine. And it was official doctrine for most of history. Capeshit is a good term for it. I don&amp;rsquo;t think most Christians believe the religious stuff is real. If I literally believed my God puts infants in hell I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be &amp;hellip;worried about some ancient cultures practicing infanticide or modern day abortions. The god is a million times worse than any human could be. But most don&amp;rsquo;t believe in this doctrine even where it is on the books or logically applies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THREAD: Did you know that a student filed a complaint against Hindu professors at @dartmouth just bc they were Hindu?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Didn’t hear about it? Our team investigated the biggest Hinduphobic scandal in Dartmouth’s history. First and foremost, while we recognize that the details of the case are sensitive and centered around sexual harassment, this will not be the focus of the thread. So, what happened?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maha Hasan Alshawi was a graduate student at Dartmouth College. In February 2020, Alshawi met with Dartmouth’s Deputy Title IX Coordinator Gary Sund and Title IX Coordinator Kristi Clemens to report an alleged incident of sexual harassment.&#xA;She had reported that her research advisor, Professor Li, “touched his private area inappropriately” for 20 to 30 seconds. The professor denied the allegations and maintained that at the time of the alleged incident he was in Macau, China and Washington, D.C. for conferences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Even if fellow-Abrahamics are mortal enemies, a Pagan who extends shelter to one never really wins their loyalty or trust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;david-and-saul&#34;&gt;David and Saul&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The scene: David flees Israelite territory. King Saul is trying to kill him, no matter how much David tries to prove his bona fides. David + 600 soldiers (w/ families) take shelter with Philistine King Achish of Gath - pagans the Israelites hate. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/fGyP041ahB&#34;&gt;https://t.co/fGyP041ahB&lt;/a&gt;) Pagan king Achish grants David a town to settle in, hoping to win favour through hospitality. And perhaps driving a wedge in Israel. Instead, behind his host&amp;rsquo;s back, David and his men sack and massacre nearby pagan settlements - making sure that the king doesn&amp;rsquo;t hear of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Robert Aumann the Nobel Laureate economist.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is also a growing group of Orthodox Jews known as Hardalim. They are Religious Zionists who moved in their religious observances towards Haredi Judaism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Modern orthodox jews conduct military-style camps which militarily prepare youth. This has led to the recent ascent of orthodox Jewish officers in the Israeli army.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;haredim&#34;&gt;Haredim&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aka Ultra Orthodox Jew.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;strict adherence to halakha (Jewish law) and traditions. a historical continuum of Rabbinic Judaism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;population-share&#34;&gt;Population share&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Their estimated global population numbers over 1.8 million, and, due to a virtual absence of interfaith marriage and a high birth rate, the Haredi population is growing rapidly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;israel&#34;&gt;Israel&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;12.6% of Israel&amp;rsquo;s population.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;By 2030, the Haredi Jewish community is projected to make up 16% of the total population, and by 2065, a third of the Israeli population.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Haredi women having an average of 6.7 children, while the average Jewish Israeli woman has 3 children.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The percentage of people leaving the Haredi population has been estimated between 6% and 18%.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;20% of the Haredi population are thought to belong to the Sephardic Haredi stream.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;usa&#34;&gt;USA&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The United States has the second largest Haredi population, which has a growth rate on pace to double every 20 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In 2013, it has been estimated that there were 530,000 total Orthodox Jews in the United States, or 10% of all American Jews.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;uk&#34;&gt;UK&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In 1998, the Haredi population in the Jewish community of the United Kingdom was estimated at 27,000 (13% of affiliated Jews).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In comparison with the national average of 2.4 children per family, Haredi families have an average of 5.9 children&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;proselytism&#34;&gt;Proselytism&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some Haredi groups, like Chabad-Lubavitch, encourage outreach to less-observant and unaffiliated Jews and hilonim. See also Baal teshuva movement.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even Sephardic Haredi have adapted clothing and culture of the Lithuanian Haredi Judaism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hasidim&#34;&gt;Hasidim&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;draws heavily on Lurianic Kabbalah. Teachings emphasize God&amp;rsquo;s immanence in the universe, the need to cleave and be one with him at all times, the devotional aspect of religious practice, and the spiritual dimension of corporeality and mundane acts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;organized in independent sects known as &amp;ldquo;courts&amp;rdquo; or dynasties, each headed by its own hereditary leader, a Rebbe.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As of 2016, there were over 130,000 Hasidic households worldwide, about 5% of the global Jewish population.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;state-power&#34;&gt;State power&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the founding of political Zionism in the 1890s, Haredi Jewish leaders voiced objections to its secular orientation, and before the establishment of the State of Israel, the vast majority of Haredi Jews were opposed to Zionism.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This was chiefly due to the concern that secular nationalism would replace the Jewish faith and the observance of religion, and the view that it was forbidden for the Jews to re-constitute Jewish rule in the Land of Israel before the arrival of the Messiah.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are a number of Haredi groups which not only oppose Zionism, but also do not recognize the State of Israel.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Haredi view Zionism as blasphemous sacrilege that is trying to establish a Jewish state without the sanction of Yahweh. Haredi believe the Jews have been cursed by Yahweh to be a stateless people until the  Messiah comes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Around 80% of European Haredim perished in the Holocaust.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many Haredi males simply collect state money, study torah and breed - women may work to provide additional support, and they are socialized to value the best Torah scholar.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;participation-in-state&#34;&gt;Participation in state&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, most Sephardi Haredi authorities have never shared the anti-Zionism of their Ashkenazi counterparts&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Post holocaust - more Haredi groups became pro-zionist.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;During the past two decades a small but growing number of Haredi have volunteered to join the military, often going against their parents’ wishes, and in many cases being rejected by their families. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/14/fighters-not-rabbis-torah-students-who-chose-the-gun-reveal-israels-bitter-divide&#34;&gt;G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;According to a 2016 Pew survey, 33% of Israeli Haredim say that the term &amp;ldquo;Zionist&amp;rdquo; describes them accurately.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;family&#34;&gt;Family&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In 2016, the divorce rate was 5% among the Haredi population, compared to the general population rate of 14%.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;modernity&#34;&gt;Modernity&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Allow only curated videos, newspapers and internet - sometimes not even that.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Haredi women wear attractive wigs - follow fashion - while maintaining Halakha.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Follow Shabbat and family feasts religiously and joyfully.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

And &lt;strong&gt;because they were used to slaughter many oxen in the sacrifice to devils some solemnity must be exchanged for them&lt;/strong&gt; on this account - On the day of the dedication or the nativities of the holy martyrs whose relics are there deposited they may build themselves huts of the boughs of trees about those churches which have been turned to that use from temples and &lt;strong&gt;celebrate the solemnity with religious feasting. They are no more to offer up beasts to the devil but to slay and eat them to the praise of God&lt;/strong&gt; and return thanks to the Giver of all good for their satiety for thus while they are permitted these gratifications they will the more readily attend to what leads to inward and spiritual satisfaction For there is no doubt but that it is impossible to retrench all at once with obdurate minds because he who would ascend to the highest place rises by degrees or steps and not by leaps These things you are affectionately to communicate to our brother Augustine that he may consider how he is to order all things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

At the worship site, there were free meals offered to guests. To Ramasamy&amp;rsquo;s shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Ramasamy&amp;rsquo;s entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;disdain-for-failure-hindu&#34;&gt;Disdain for &amp;ldquo;failure&amp;rdquo; hindu&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sikhism has latent abrahamist tendencies. In a way, it is proto-islamophile-secularism. Same with many baba-isms. See &lt;a href=&#34;../Anti-hindu_patterns/&#34;&gt;anti-hindu patterns page&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;miri-piri&#34;&gt;mIri-pIri&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It aimed to rearm hindus (spiritually and materially) during oppressive Mughal muslim times by emphasizing (even by &amp;ldquo;democratizing&amp;rdquo;) kShatra. In a sense, they revived the Steppe warrior ethos - albeit in a limited sense (lacking in sophistication, and with many unArya tendencies).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-kin-marker-temorarily-increasing-group-fitness&#34;&gt;Virtual kin marker temorarily increasing group fitness&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this context one could also bring up the case of the pA&lt;del&gt;nchanada-uShnIShamoha. This moha emerged as result of part but not whole of the khilimoha infecting the Hindu population of the pa&lt;/del&gt;nchanada. The result was the emergence of a new recombinant memetic virus, the uShnIShamoha that retained the self-propagating tendencies of the original khilimoha. This infection was very mild in terms of fitness reduction, but provided a strong virtual kin marker that allowed the infected group to prevail and spread at the expense of the Hindus of the pa~nchanada, and also offered protection to the infected against being overrun by the spreading khilimoha. But as its numbers increased its utility as such a virtual kin marker diminished. Nevertheless, it continues to serve this purpose to a degree in new areas colonized by its carriers, such as North America.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;So, the representation of Hindu traditions by dry scholars tends to be maddeningly flawed (whether in their textbooks, books or talks). Practitioners on the other hand are more reliable. But a *scholarly practitioner* is the best. This is the difference between शुष्क-पण्डितता and आर्द्रमना ऋषिः.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Analogies: How valuable (to insiders or outsiders) are books about making Indian music or dancing, if written by one who does not do either?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some famous examples of scholar practitioners: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/Robert.A.F.Thurman?hc_location=ufi&#34;&gt;Robert Thurman&lt;/a&gt;, M Hiriyanna, shatavadhanI gaNesh, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pandurang-Vaman-Kane/109228925762949?hc_location=ufi&#34;&gt;Pandurang Vaman Kane&lt;/a&gt;, monastics and scholars associated with n traditional institutions in India and abroad, Dalai Lama.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Examples: [duties vs rights ??].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;उक्तं खलु भगवत्पादशङ्करैः&amp;quot;सर्वशास्त्रवित् असम्प्रदायवित् मूर्खवदुपेक्षणीय&amp;quot; इति।&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An analysis of western scholar practitioners in Hinduism: fewer scholars openly declare their hindu practice compared to buddhism [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/11637543/Asymmetrical_Religious_Commitments_Religious_Practice_Identity_and_Self-Presentation_among_Western_Scholars_of_Hinduism_and_Buddhism&#34;&gt;AC16&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;contrast-with-hindu-system&#34;&gt;Contrast with hindu system&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Contrast with the Hindu system. Steven Hopkins on the nature of commentaries in the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition: &amp;ldquo;In this tradition, (…) to comment on a text is not so much to dissect it into minute doctrinal particulars, but rather to &lt;strong&gt;re-experience it&lt;/strong&gt;. Commentary here is a kind of imaginative participation, a “spiritual enjoyment” equal in the intensity of relish to the enjoyment of God in the root text.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;jIva-gosvAmin&amp;rsquo;s criterion in sarvasaMvAdiNI- &amp;ldquo;He has set a very high bar for one wishing to be &amp;lsquo;Hindu theologian&amp;rsquo; in the contemporary context: He was well versed in &lt;strong&gt;śruti, smrti, vyākarana, kāvya, mimārsā, nyāya, pāñcarātra, and vedānta and its commentaries&lt;/strong&gt;, and had a seasoned knowledge of the Bhāgavata, which is itself a massive scripture. That would be a curriculum hard for most to match. But more importantly, we can only suggest that he would say a Hindu theologian must be one with a &lt;strong&gt;God-given experience&lt;/strong&gt; that allows them to understand the intention (tātparya) of scripture. For him this can only occur in and through a traditional educational process; he argues in his &lt;strong&gt;Bhaktisandarbha&lt;/strong&gt; (208) that, &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;knowledge of scripture can manifest only by hearing from a śravana-guru&lt;/strong&gt; (the teacher with whom one studies) and not otherwise&amp;rsquo; (Dāsa and Martin 2006, p.680). This is a widely held belief among many who consider themselves in or representing a sampradāya.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic-points&#34;&gt;Academic points&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wanting to appear smart/ score an academic point&amp;rdquo; types tend to miss the forest for the woods, and (many a time, unfortunately) tend to make others fall into the same pattern. In contrast, a practitioner keeps looking for the *heart* of the issue (in the way that affects/ affected practice and the truth). So, this petty desire to show how smart they are motivates the former, not a truly noble desire to attain a sense of Atma+abhyudaya.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rather they play a game similar to what Aristotle is said to have taught Alexander – eristics – something the Macedonian warrior is said to have enjoyed. In eristics you can successively take either side of an argument and argue for it being the correct one. Similarly, members of this cluster, who are particularly common in elite American academia, can take up a viewpoint and argue for it without really being interested in investigating the truth – seemingly it is an intellectual game for their high IQs. At the long end of history much of this cluster can be seen as making little lasting intellectual contribution beyond creating ferment in their times.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/08/15/in-the-gray-zone/&#34;&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is compounded by the fashion of being deliberately irreverent in their scholarly rhetoric as a way of indicating membership with the mlecCha Indology system.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Example: The &amp;ldquo;ironic&amp;rdquo; twist to hammIra-kAvya &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPV8CpV1bSc#t=15&#34;&gt;YT16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;desaffronization-of-texts&#34;&gt;Desaffronization of texts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;tend to disregard the religious garb of such texts&amp;rdquo; (&amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Of course, one wonders why someone who does not really care for Hindu religion or mysticism is in the business of examining Hindu texts. What might be the motivations?)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The pANDya states: &amp;ldquo;All Muslim states make full use of their countries’ natural products- gold, pearls and precious objects [and with] all their surpluses the Muslims come [here] to trade&amp;rdquo; This suggests that by 1280 CE the Mohd were using their wealth to get a grip on South Indian markets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Maccabean dynastic period was one round of persecutions and forced conversions by Jews on Jews after another. The Romans got involved there because of Jewish infighting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;King Jannaeus had Pharisees crucified by the hundreds because he supported a different type of Judaism.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Samaritans were persecuted by other Jews and had their temple destroyed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Idumaeans were forced to become Jews at sword point.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There was a temple in Egypt founded by Jews and a branch of the priestly dynasty who were run out of the Jerusalem temple, yet more infighting over religion. The high priest claimant Onias was assassinated by other Jews near or at the Grove of Daphne while under Greek protection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;relation-to-local-systems&#34;&gt;Relation to local systems&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;the world has come a long way from the sārthavāha-s of yore who even when wide-ranging did not disrupt the local systems. For instance, in say the Marahaṭṭā country, where we formerly lived, there was the system of the bārā balutedāra-s which has perhaps lasted in some form from the pre-Āryan days of the Harappan civilization. This system comprised of 12 jāti-s who offered essential services for a village. These spanned the entire range from the jāti-s with a low social rank to those with a large component of steppe ancestry and old Āryan descent who were high-ranked. Irrespective of the real or imagined the local issues rising from inter-jāti conflicts, these still for most part worked as a rather cohesive unit for probably at least 1400 years. The sārthavāha operated on top of this system and bore produce across the country and beyond. However, such vaṇij-s did not do anything to interfere disruptively with the system in the villages.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/06/08/pandemic-days-the-fizz-is-out-of-the-bottle/&#34;&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The modern sārthavāha built by the stock market or the internet is mostly a contrasting species. It is clear they have greater reach and rapacity than the old sārthavāha-s but they are also prone to more evil. There is an entire spectrum of the balance of evil they cause to the utility they provide to society.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;evil-social-engineering-schemes&#34;&gt;Evil social engineering schemes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;these idols of society are not purveying the neutral capitalism that the mleccha elite worship but a new unmāda +++(Leftist 0-theism)+++. This, along with their global reach, has allowed that unmāda to attain pandemic proportions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The self-enriching mithyā-kraya-kartṛ Sora +++(Soros)+++ has absolutely nothing useful to offer to the world and a purely evil player.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The vyāpārin Bejha +++(Bezos)+++ offers several useful services for the jana-samudāya but has leveraged the wealth he has accumulated in the process to do evil.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Among the corporations, karṇa-piśācī guggulu +++(Google)+++ might offer some small services of use to the populace but has used its capture of an important resource to further evil.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;A similar situation is seen with the duṣṭa, Jāka the dāraka +++(Twitter Jack)+++: he offers a platform for online advertisement and conversation but has used it to further evil causes and contribute to the demise of freedom of expression. Probably, Mukhagiri also falls in the same category as Jāka the dāraka.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivations&#34;&gt;Motivations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;atonement-for-rapacity&#34;&gt;Atonement for Rapacity&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;They are to a degree conscious that their rapacious actions cause a measure of harm to individuals and the emergent entity known as society which they comprise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Moreover, in the past the mleccha and mūla-rugṇa sārthavāha-s used to practice what came to be known as capitalism in an unbridled way and they saw that it acquired a bad name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like all humans they too subliminally subscribe to the view that they can gain compensatory puṇya by performing acts in support of religion. In the past, the sārthavāha-s in our midst too, keen to acquire puṇya, used to make donations to various deva-prāsāda-s or build new ones themselves (or pāṣaṇdālaya-s).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;subscription-to-0-theisms&#34;&gt;Subscription to 0-theisms&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;This +++(0-theist)+++ version of the unmāda is now the ascendant religion among the employees of or of these very sārthavāha-s themselves. Thus, what has happened is that they seek to earn puṇya by granting endowments for this new abrahma-ruj.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even if one were not infected fully by this secular mutation of the old unmāda-s, among the lay mleccha-s there is a certain naive econolatory: they worship the faceless market running by its own vrata-s and attribute all human abhyudaya to these magical market forces. They see it as self-correcting and the panacea for all evil — whereas in the past they used see the prathama and dvitīya unmāda-s as the foundation of their well-being they now either additionally or exclusively genuflect towards the miraculous market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-reinforcement&#34;&gt;Social reinforcement&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In this worship of the market, especially given that it is faceless, its purveyors, the vaṇij, naturally become important idols in society.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Snippets from some writings by an American woman Elizabeth Reed in the early 1900s illustrating some of the roots of the American strain of white indology. The peculiarly American conception of race consciousness was making its beginnings in indology. Remember this woman&amp;rsquo;s blatherings were studied as recommended textbooks in American colleges for years after her death. Her successors similar say similar things in more &amp;ldquo;sophisticated&amp;rdquo; language or the language of current usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They are, for the most part, traitors, anti-Europeans who rejoice in the destruction of our pagan heritage in the name of the god of the Jews. They have no intellectual honesty, they are in a seemingly permanent state of cognitive dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what you tell them, no matter how many rabbi clips you show them, they will insist that Jesus was not a Jew. I don’t believe many of them are capable of any level of critical thinking, they hate the Jews, yet they can’t even tell you why, because their hatred is confined to the insane belief that they “killed God”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/&#34;&gt;MT13&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-high-fitness-for-the-virus&#34;&gt;Initial high fitness for the virus&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When there is a large uninfected population in the vicinity then infection by khilimoha might benefit the individual because it induces him to perform acts of ghazwat that allows him to capture women from the uninfected and increase his fitness by fathering offspring on them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reversal-as-host-diminishes&#34;&gt;Reversal as host diminishes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;However, as this population decreases then there are diminishing returns for ultimately the sex ratio always tends to 1. A situation much like there being few or no bacteria in their given space of existence that lack the bacteriocin plasmid. No fitness gain, perhaps only loss. But this might trigger warfare within the khilimohita population resulting in deaths that could bring down fitness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;pyramid-scheme-transfer-of-benefits&#34;&gt;Pyramid scheme transfer of benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If an uninfected individual voluntarily contracts khilonmAda hoping that it might enhance his fitness, in most cases this was unlikely to be the case. For much of its existence khilonmAda ran as a pyramid scheme. Those who got it first benefit the most and at the expense of those who got in latter. For example, if a guy decided to become &lt;strong&gt;khilonmadita he is most likely to enter as a lowly ajlaf rather than as an ashraf, a sheikh or an amir&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed he was most likely to be cannon fodder who became a shahid with nullified fitness in a Jihad rather than being the recipient of a train of bibi-s to spend his nights enhancing his fitness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This situation is illustrated on multiple occasions in the history of marUnmAda in the subcontinent of jambudvIpa. For example, at the root of the split of the Bahmanid empire in Southern India was the conflict between the Deccani marUnmatta-s and the amirs and sheikhs arriving from the maru and central Asia. Despite having become marUnmatta-s the Deccanis were hardly getting much traction in terms of accruing benefits that might enhance their fitness – these instead went to the big beards arriving from abroad.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Closer to our times one could cite the example of how Sajid Mir enhanced his fitness while his infected stooges, the merry Bombay blasters, brought theirs down to zero. Here, their fitness erasure was directly induced by the khilonmAda but their brains being spilled on the streets of Mumbai did not damage khilonmAda in any serious way.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-kin-marker-view&#34;&gt;Virtual kin marker view&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One could argue that the infection of a group by khilonmada provides a &lt;strong&gt;virtual kin marker&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. makes them feel like an in-group against the background of uninfected individuals who have no specially identity. This situation might be compared to certain mobile genetic elements encoding proteins that allow organisms to distinguish themselves from their conspecifics and act beneficially towards and self-sacrifice for others bearing the same genetic element but not the general background of conspecifics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This could initially enhance the fitness of that group infected by that genetic element as opposed to those which are not. But in this group selection scenario the individual’s fitness is not necessarily raised but those of the group and the khilimoha meme-complex are. This might &lt;strong&gt;help survival of the group in the short term but as everyone in the niche becomes infected then the utility of the meme-complex for the group diminishes or vanishes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The infection of the Chechens in the Caucasus could be presented as an example of this. The reason it seems to work well for them is that they are surrounded by a large population of the uninfected. The same phenomenon might also be invoked in the case of accommodation of marUnmAda by parameshvara in Malaysia, the eventual conversion of his son late in is life and the events set in motion by it in the far east.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;maladaptive-social-upheaval&#34;&gt;Maladaptive social upheaval&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a romantic view presented by apologists of the khilimoha that it helped emancipate the lower rungs of the social pyramid of heathen societies that were assailed by it. What is not told (in large part because of other modern constructs) is that the old well-structured heathen societies were reasonably well-adapted for their chosen lifestyles. Their pyramidal structure was not in large part a system for exploitation of those at the bottom by those at the top but more of a meritocracy contingent on the genetic foundations of their human resources.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thus, those at the bottom of the hierarchy were often enriched in traits that would preclude high power cognitive performance needed for complex tasks. Given this situation, their conversion to khilimoha would have hardly enhanced their fitness. If anything it might have depressed it by making them shahids for the jaysh al Islam. Moreover, khilonmAda has the quality of &lt;strong&gt;destroying structure within societies it conquests&lt;/strong&gt; because it has a rather simple social model.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thus, conversion of individuals form a pagan society to the rAkShasamata results in their being &lt;strong&gt;uprooted from their social scaffold&lt;/strong&gt; as well as, to a degree, their &lt;strong&gt;organic connections to the land&lt;/strong&gt;. This could result in a reduction of their fitness. For example, the break down of Hindu social structure with the spread of Islam resulted in much lower capability to withstand famine from El Niño oscillations. Thus larger numbers of those who had converted to Islam in the Bahmanid sultanate perished (e.g. the durgAdevI famine).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This possibly explains why &lt;strong&gt;most pagan societies fought the coming of the khilimoha tooth-and-nail&lt;/strong&gt; before it was forcibly thrust upon them by military defeat. If not, it seized them during period of social decline and breakdown – again a phenomenon prevalent during the take over of the far east.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;recap&#34;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, given that the rAkShasamata is bloody both within and without (to paraphrase Samuel Huntington) it confers an edge if it surrounded by and confronting memetically weakened competitors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;However, if it is the only dominant force then it will &lt;strong&gt;inexorably draw the society to a “basket case”&lt;/strong&gt; (think Somalia, Sudan and an Arab world without bhUmitaila) that might have a lower average fitness for an individual than a well ordered heathen society.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;instability-as-a-feature&#34;&gt;Instability as a feature&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;marUnmAda is bloody within &amp;amp; without. +++(&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s more muslim?&amp;rdquo; fights.)+++&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;instability is an intrinsic feature of marUnmAda that only puzzles the H who think the world runs the way they believe it should.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Suren&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditional trader V3s got into usury, as did various V1 and V4 jAtis with large landholdings who took a new avatar as tax farmers. This broke the unspoken social contract. However, native V3 and V4 that engaged in usury largely escaped the scrutiny through their participation in ethno-nationalist movements as the thinkers and drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Chettiar-Mudaliar-Vellalar triumvirate of Dravidianism is a classic example. They were all moneylenders, tax farmers and bureaucrats who has gotten rich off of the British Empire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The attacks were the most destructive and coordinated bomb explosions in the country&amp;rsquo;s history.&#xA;The explosives went off within 75 minutes of each other across several districts of India&amp;rsquo;s financial capital. The blasts were caused at prestigious and important buildings like Mumbai Stock Exchange, Air-India Building, Hotel Sea Rock, Hotel Juhu Centaur, Hotel Airport Centaur and busy commercial areas like Zaveri Bazar, Century Bazar and Katha Bazar. Explosions were also caused near Shiv Sena Bhawan and at Plaza Theatre. Simultaneously, hand-grenades were thrown at Sahar International Airport and at Fishermen&amp;rsquo;s Colony inhabited by members of Hindu community at Mahim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Unlike the old thinkers discussed above, it is important to realize that the metaphysics of neo-vedānta or yoga are pretty useless by themselves in serving as a globalized version of the dharma. Rather the emphasis should be on rituals, which will become rites and festivals of the state at large as well as local provinces, both in India and elsewhere.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;RSS sponsored Gatherings of Elders - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/6999798/The_Gatherings_of_the_Elders._The_Beginnings_oa_Pagan_International&#34;&gt;KE12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

In the early stages of Jewish theology YHWH &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;the satan&amp;rdquo; were used interchangeably. As their theology evolved Satan became a proper noun &amp;amp; a separate being from YHWH. Compare an early writing: 2 Sam.24.1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again the anger of YHWH burned against Israel &amp;amp; HE incited David against them, saying, “Go &amp;amp; take a census of&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What is perfectly natural for a normal healthy person is extraordinary for such a person. The extraordinary muslim who is good to kufr interests may be noted with excitement just as the extraordinary handicapped person climbing mount Everest. It is foolish to conclude from such examples that polio or the resulting &amp;ldquo;loss of limb&amp;rdquo; is no serious impediment to movement (let alone mountaineering).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See muslim typography &lt;a href=&#34;../types/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;limited-potency-of-the-mildly-infected&#34;&gt;Limited potency of the mildly infected&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a muslim society, these numerous tolerant muslims tend not to successfully challenge their more virulent corelegionists that stick to their constitution (Quran, Hadith etc..) - as observing Terrorist state of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia etc.. (as of 2014) will reveal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;So, while some may make some statements sympathizing with victims of jihaadi attacks, condemning terrorists - they hardly take to arms at a rate sufficient to neutralize their anti-kufr jihadi warriors. So, the net effect of Islam remains negative to the kufr population.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rather, they tend to mostly cooperate (with or without misgivings) in heinous acts. So, it certainly matters what the RoP holy books say.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But, their &amp;ldquo;moderation&amp;rdquo; has very weak theological basis/ solid clerical support, as explained in a separate section.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Related streams: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23u3mob&amp;amp;f=live&#34;&gt;#u3mob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;../images/islamist_maNDalas.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;../images/islamist_maNDalas.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-muslims&#34;&gt;Good muslims&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many muslims are good (or atleast appear good under many circumstances) and benign towards non-muslims despite their religion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Such goodness (or appearence thereof) may manifest itself through statements sympathizing with victims of jihaadi attacks, condemning jihadi terrorists, and very rarely - by actually fighting against jihadis.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not every Nazi party member during WW2 was actually a bad person - there were even the likes of Oskar Schindler - similar is the case with Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eg: &lt;a href=&#34;http://dharmadeen.com/&#34;&gt;dharmadeen list&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/gay-muslim-imam-brings-message-of-tolerance-to-europe-a-985863.html#spRedirectedFrom=www&amp;amp;referrrer=http://t.co/EC09h1pcc4&#34;&gt;gay imam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;source-of-goodness&#34;&gt;Source of goodness&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Islam is not the only motivator for every action of a muslim.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some apparent goodness towards the kufr is a matter of posturing (taqiyyah) - a precautionary dissimulation or denial of religious belief and practice under compulsion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

It destroy not just their children but their whole lineages. But few are aware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The storming of the citadels of science, tech&amp;amp; medicine in the occident by navyonmAda is no surprise to its careful observers. The proclivity towards that disease of the mind was already quite deep even by the 1990s and earlier &amp;ndash;sooner or later the pathogen was to totally take over the host. Similarly, it seems the H have a high degree of natural susceptibility to navyonmAda unlike some of the prAchya peoples. Thus, it ripping through an already immuno-compromised H population is not entirely a matter of surprise. Saw snippets of a video of malla on a H woman&amp;rsquo;s daughters falling to the disease. Nothing unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gabriel came and asked, &amp;ldquo;What is faith?&amp;rdquo; Allah&amp;rsquo;s Messenger replied, &amp;lsquo;Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he further asked, &amp;ldquo;What is Islam?&amp;rdquo; Allah&amp;rsquo;s Messenger replied, &amp;ldquo;To worship Allah Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay the compulsory charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he further asked, &amp;ldquo;What is Ihsan (perfection)?&amp;rdquo; Allah&amp;rsquo;s Messenger replied, &amp;ldquo;To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;geopolitical-push&#34;&gt;Geopolitical push&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A cartel of Islamic countries (led by pAkistAn and malaysia) insist on all imports (even non-meat food and non-food products like cement) having a halAl certificate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;GoI FSSAI Green dot certifying absence of meat not respected by them - they insist on halAl certificate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;consequence&#34;&gt;Consequence&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The most intolerant minority wins&amp;rdquo; rule of NN Taleb applies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;halAl slaughter requires muslim butcher. So, companies are forced to hire muslims and exclude non-muslims.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For efficiency reasons, in the absence of sufficient pressure from non-muslims, it does not make sense for companies to hire two sets of workers for the same product.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the absence of strong non-muslim reaction, non-halAl meat is then not even available to customers who prefer that. For example, airlines prefer to stock and provide only halAl meat (caterer SkyChef supplies halAl meat only).&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Halal meat is cheaper, and most customers never bother complaining. Theoretically, halAl should be more expensive (peculiar requirement of a minority community). Amazing how the tables are turned due to the &amp;ldquo;intolerant minority&amp;rdquo; principle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To access 0.25x of the market, non-muslim companies are forced to go for halAl certificate - even when it makes no sense to do so (eg. non-meat products, Ayurvedic medicine). So, they are forced to pay local muslims for nothing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reaction&#34;&gt;Reaction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Insistence of reciprocity&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If muslims refuse to eat meat butchered by Hindus (&amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t be halAl&amp;rdquo;), why should Hindus eat meat butchered by Muslims? (Many non-muslims - including hindus and sikhs since many hundred years - insist on jhaTka meat.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If muslims insist on part of the profits going to other muslims for useless certification (even on non-meat and non-food items) - should hindus not reciprocate in kind?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If GoI FSSAI Green dot certifying absence of meat is not respected by Islamic countries, why should non-muslim countries respect food certification of Islamic countries?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Government protection of non-muslim work-force and consumer choice&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Insist that stores, trains and airlines carry jhaTka meat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interesting but over-long video on the halAl tax - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CNNnews18/status/1509859167363899393&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/CNNnews18/status/1509859167363899393&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1542784913362915328.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What comes in your mind when you hear the word &amp;lsquo;Halal&amp;rsquo; ? How Halal became the &amp;lsquo;Economic Jihad&amp;rsquo; tool of Islam worldwide ? This will be a rather longish thread in parts. Bear with me and do read &amp;amp; share all parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How big is the Halal Economy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;USA : nominal GDP $20.58 trillion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;India: nominal GDP $2.94 trillion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Halal Economy: $3.6 + trillion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Halal&amp;rdquo; is an Arabic word that was in existence even before Islam, same like the word &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo;. Halal means &amp;ldquo;permissible/ legitimate&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Jayaz&amp;rdquo;. In Islam, things or doings are either Halal or Haraam. There is no Grey in between. The word Halal has seen three revolutions, Before Islam, After the Origin of Islam, After World war 2. Currently, the 4th revolution is what we are going to see and the most devastating one (devastating to the non-halal economy).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think it is not good behavior &amp;amp; reflects badly on H to be writing hate mail out of the blue. But I think like the nuclear no-first strike policy of the Indian state is a good guide: if the indologist/ activist is the 1st to strike on H then the retaliation should be in kind though ideally not by sending them hate mail unless they sent a particular H hate mail first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threader.app/thread/1435380362637676544&#34;&gt;https://threader.app/thread/1435380362637676544&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only kind of political meta-narrative that exists right now is the victim narrative. Regardless of where people lean politically, most people interpret politics through the lense of victim and oppressor. This explains many facets of the current political discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, how did we get here? In the earlier half of the 20th century, western civilization had a relatively positive view of itself. It saw itself as a saviour, a beacon for progress, not as a victim or an oppressor but a hero.+++(5)+++ As the century progressed, this meta-narrative (of western civilization as heroic) was challenged by many events: decolonization, civil rights movements, Vietnam. In turn, the values that held western civilization together for centuries were deconstructed. This is one factor that lead to the proliferation of post-modernism today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, in the end, he seemed to view Buddhist practice and Buddhist scholarship (at least of the Western variety) as ultimately irreconcilable. He told the students that if he accepted what they had told him, he would only be able to believe in the rūpakāya, the physical body of the Buddha that appears in the world to teach the dharma. He could not believe in the sambhogakāya, the body of enjoyment that appears to advanced bodhisattvas in the splendor of the pure lands, adorned with the thirty-two marks of a superman. And he could not believe in the dharmakāya, the Buddha’s omniscient mind and its nature of emptiness. “If I believed what you told me,” he said, “the Buddha would only be a nice person.”&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Supreme Court revisits 21-year-old verdict on Hindutva ahead of crucial elections&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the apex court had defined Hindutva as &amp;lsquo;a way of life&amp;rsquo;, which gave the BJP and the Shiv Sena considerable legal ground to justify their ultra-nationalist politics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Assembly elections in four states round the corner and controversies raging over cow vigilantism, triple talaq and uniform civil code, the Supreme Court is all set to revisit its two-decade old interpretation of the term Hindutva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-hinduism&#34;&gt;Defining Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Defining Hinduism, the Sanatana Dharma, in modern times has been fraught with challenges. They arise from the fact that the Indic notion of “religion” is different from the Western-Abrahamic one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hinduism does not fit the typical “religion” parameters as understood by most of the modern world. For example, Hindu Dharma is non-dogmatic. According to S. N. Balagangadhara (Balu), one of the problems of defining Hinduism is that there is no Indic notion of “religion.” When “outsiders” came into contact with India, they tried to make sense of Indic religions, including Hinduism, from their lenses. From Albiruni to Wendy Doniger, they have attempted to define Hinduism from their religious and ideological prisms and prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One can observe within and without social media how people vilify hindutva (for example by sharing such rot [insert link]). They will do everything they can to make 卍 look like 卐. One must ask oneself how much one&amp;rsquo;s welfare coincides with theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tactics a typical western politically active indologist (eg. Sheldon Pollock) uses are-&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He plays bad cop when it comes to an assertive and virile hindu civilization. Not even disguised under the thin veneer of smooth talk is the argument for Hindus not dominating India: So that what&amp;rsquo;s left may be lapped up by RoP and RoL. Eg. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/News-Analysis/2016-04-06/Mughal-rulers-patronised-Sanskrit-literature-took-up-Persian-translations-of-Hindu-epics/219377#.VwWooIkdMe0.facebook&#34;&gt;Trushcke16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He plays good cop and advocates for hindu (nay &amp;ldquo;South asian&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ancient Indian&amp;rdquo; oh anything but &amp;ldquo;hindu&amp;rdquo;) civilization, as long as it is as a neutered pet subservient to his western (ie. abrahamistic / hebraic) ideals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-guise-of-being-center-mainstream&#34;&gt;The guise of being &amp;ldquo;center&amp;rdquo;/ mainstream.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Coming to contents, Truschke accuses “Hindu Right-wingers” of attacks on “academics”. I would have expected them to attack “anti-Hindu Left-wingers”, and indeed I learn that this is exactly how they see it,&amp;ndash; and how they see her. If she doesn’t like being characterized this way, she is herewith invited to stop calling her adversaries similar names. The binary Left/Right is at least problematic here, yet for a quarter century I have seen this scheme used to explain matters. Except that the Left doesn’t call itself Left: it treats itself as the natural centre, and anything to its right is deemed politically coloured: “Right” or very easily “extreme Right”.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278&#34;&gt;KE16&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many thologians have rewritten accounts of Jesus&amp;rsquo; life to compensate for deficiencies in the NT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The existence of archangel Gabriel is historically accurate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Parthenogenesis in humans is historically accurate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jesus being born before 4 BC (&amp;ldquo;in the days of king Herod&amp;rdquo;) and after 6 AD (during the first census when Quirinius was governor of Syria) is historically accurate, despite these dates being mutually exclusive by approximately a decade.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A universal census requiring people to travel to ancestral towns, an event unattested in Roman administrative records, is historically accurate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Joseph and Mary leaving Nazareth and arriving at a city which just so happens to have the same name as the Messianic tribe mentioned in Micah 5:2 is historically accurate and in no way suggests retroactive Messianic prophecy fulfillment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Babylonian wise men divining the birth of a Jewish messiah via astrology (a practice condemned elsewhere in the Bible, BTW) and traveling to an obscure Judean backwater in alleged fulfillment of the Seventy Weeks prophecy of Daniel is historically accurate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Herod ordering the slaughter of all infants in Judea is historically accurate, notwithstanding the absence of any extrabiblical attestation from any contemporary historians who meticulously recorded Herod&amp;rsquo;s far smaller atrocities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of this is legendary. None of this is messianic or theological propaganda. This is all history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That is the &amp;ldquo;secular&amp;rdquo; interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;jewish-killing&#34;&gt;Jewish killing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They (Christians) believe the Biblical narrative in which Jesus was God and was &amp;ldquo;killed&amp;rdquo; neither by the Jews and Romans. In the Biblical narrative, the Jewish pharisees and high priest demand that Jesus be crucified even though Pilate saw no fault in Jesus. Even when given the option to pardon a criminal, the Jews favored the murder/bandit Barabbas over Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human Sacrifice as a Biblical Practice&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many will tell you that the Israelites did not practice human sacrifice to Yahweh. The evidence is to the contrary. There is a bias toward this claim because our view of that ancient people is colored by the biases of Abrahamic claims.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a topic I had intended address from the start. Human sacrifice is in the Bible, particularly the Old Testament or Tanakh. Some cases are well known, but it is actually much more common than most know. Language and translation conceal an important concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Then they get killed by pagans, which the Christians describe as the unjustified murder of an innocent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Christain saints and missionaries like Cyril and Bonerface were part communist &amp;ldquo;community organizer&amp;rdquo; and part Taliban death squad leader.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;There was a 1583 revolt in Goa (then under Portuguese) called Cuncolim revolt where the locals killed missionaries going around destroying temples, they were turned into &amp;ldquo;martyrs&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; beatified.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;digestion&#34;&gt;Digestion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Digestion of icon-worship and polytheism within Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Christianity&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In Catholicism there are many angels and saints, whose icons are worshiped, sometimes infused with prechristian rites, identities and traits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;roman-empire&#34;&gt;Roman empire&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vandalism [&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/897631604574744580&#34;&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The charity route [Julian &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/894579184487481344&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;hasten to attack the temples with sticks and stones and bars of iron, and in some cases, disdaining these, with hands and feet. Then utter desolation follows, with the stripping of roofs, demolition of walls, the tearing down of statues and the overthrow of altars, and the priests must either keep quiet or die. After demolishing one, they scurry to another, and to a third, and trophy is piled on trophy, in contravention of the law. Such outrages occur even in the cities, but they are most common in the countryside. Many are the foes who perpetrate the separate attacks, but after their countelss crimes this scattered rabble congregates and they are in disgrace unless they have committed the foulest outrage. Temples, Sire, are the soul of the countryside: they mark the beginning of its settlement, and have been passed down through many generations to the men of today. - Libanius&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Then the Mamluqs of Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan carved out the casing stones of the great pyramid to build masjids but could not get down the colossus. &amp;quot; &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/some-meanderings-among-golden-stuff/&#34;&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sphynxes:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It may have been this popular practice of ordinary people venerating, as did their ancestors, what was perceived by others as a pagan symbol, that angered a certain pious Sheikh from a Sufi establishment, Khanqah Sa&amp;rsquo;id Al-Suada, who went up to the Sphinx and disfigured his face. Shortly afterwards, Alexandria was sacked for a week in October 1365 CE by the Crusader ruler of Cyprus, Pierre I of Lusignan, an event described by Al-Minufi (d 1524) (Al-Fayd: fol 52a) as a divine retribution for the desecration of the Sphinx. Al-Minufi went on to remind his readers that monuments should be left intact, following the guiding example of the Companions of the Prophet who had visited the area and had not, in spite of their religious piety, objected to any of its monuments, thus echoing the same sentiments as expressed by Al-Idrisi (Anwar: 45f). Al-Minufi does not give us the name of this Sufi Sheikh but Al-Maqrizi (Khifat 1: 333) gave his name as Şaiem AlDahr, reporting the views of the local people that the sand had taken over their land as a punishment for the disfigurement of the statue. More detail of this Sufi Sheikh is given by Ibn Qadi Shuhba (d 1448), who recorded his name among notables who died in the year 1384 as Muhammad Ibn Sidiq Ibn Muhammad AlTibrizi Al-Misri, also known as Saiem Al-Dahr. According to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, he disfigured the sphinxes of Qanaţir Al-Sibas, and he may well also have been responsible for disfiguring the one at Giza.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lybia - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling&#34;&gt;NYT15&lt;/a&gt;: Under a line of vandalized bas-reliefs, I saw a spray-painted message in Arabic script: “Destroy the stone idols, no to restoration.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;india&#34;&gt;India&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;northern-jihads&#34;&gt;Northern jihads:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Comparison of religious sites 8-12 ce vs 12-15 ce : &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vvkbkvv/status/523883328882368513&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mahmUd of ghazni&amp;rsquo;s attacks on somanath&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sikandar bhut-shikAn in kAshmira&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kAlA-pahAD in orissa&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Numerous mosques clearly show evidence of being built upon or using material from Hindu temples.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Quwwat-ul-Islam_Mosque near Qutb Minar [&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam_Mosque&#34;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;TSP:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Multan/ Kaffirkot (&lt;a href=&#34;https://paper.li/vAsukeya/1414422064#!photos&#34;&gt;MT1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/581327521272197120&#34;&gt;TW1&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Surviving temples : &lt;a href=&#34;http://swarajyamag.com/magazine/faith-under-a-shadow/&#34;&gt;SW1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;awrangzeb&#34;&gt;awrangzeb&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;several notable cases; especially kAshi vishvanAtha temple, somanAtha temple, Keshav Rai temple of mathura (idols were brought to Agra and layed under the steps of Jahanara&amp;rsquo;s mosque), temples in Someshwar and Udaipur.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;awrangzeb was heavily restrained during the initial years of his reign.

The mockery of the goddess&amp;rsquo;s idol can be applied to any religious object, e.g. the Guru Granth. Set it on fire &amp;amp; it won&amp;rsquo;t defend itself, nor will it rat on you. Lifeless.&amp;rdquo; - KE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, after the battle of Kartarpur he went to Phagwāra. From there, since it was difficult for him to stay in any place near Lahore, he proceeded to Karaitpur (Kiratpur) which is situated within the Punjāb hills. That area belonged to Rāja Tärächand, who did not pursue the path of allegiance and obedience to King Shāhjahān. The people of that area worshipped images. On the top of the mountain an image of a goddess, known as Naina Devi has been set up. Rājas and others from the territories around, going to that place, followed the custom of making a pilgrimage [to it]. When the Guru settled himself there, a Sikh of his, Bhairū by name, going to the temple, broke the nose of the goddess. The Rājas got the news of it and complained to the Guru, taking his [Bhairu&amp;rsquo;s] name. The Gurū summoned Bhairū. Bhairu denied it. The Rājas&amp;rsquo; servants said, “We recongnise this (man).&amp;quot; He replied, &amp;ldquo;O Rājas, ask the goddess. If she takes my name, you can kill me.&amp;rdquo; The Rājas said, &amp;ldquo;Fool, how can the goddess speak?&amp;rdquo; Bhairū broke into laughter, saying, “One now knows who is the fool. When she cannot prohibit anyone from breaking her own head, and cannot identify the person who has attacked her, what good do you expect from her, and why do you worship her?” The Rājas were put to silence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

More than 20 percent of Iranian couples cannot conceive, according to a study conducted by one of the country&amp;rsquo;s leading fertility clinics, compared with the global rate of between 8 and 12 percent. Experts believe this is due to the prevalence of consanguineous marriages, or those between cousins. Male infertility is &amp;ldquo;the hidden story of the Middle East,&amp;rdquo; says Marcia Inhorn, a Yale University medical anthropologist and a specialist on assisted reproduction in the region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My heartfelt thanks goes out to them for organising the event and for being such gracious hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AT THE OUTSET, I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to the oganisers of the Pondicherry Literature Festival for inviting me. My additional gratitude is also due to them for two profound reasons. The first is the choice of the venue…this is the city sanctified by Sri Aurobindo’s lifelong penance and his brilliant vision that continues to reveal itself in multiple realms…of spirituality, nationalism, freedom, Bharatiyata, and history. The second reason is the thoughtfulness and timeliness on the part of the organisers in the choice of topic: Indian historiography at 75. Indeed, it is highly befitting that we should be discussing this on the occasion of Azadi ka Amritmahtosav… 75 years of celebrating India’s freedom from foreign rule.&#xA;Historians: Then and Now&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-nicene-romances&#34;&gt;Pre-Nicene romances&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 5th century, we basically have pseudo-historical romance (Acts of Thomas), hearsay from Eusebius&amp;rsquo; (Hebrew copy of Gospel of Matthew discovered by Pantaneus) and the Chronicle of Seert (a 9th-11th century text claiming that David of Basra evangelized India in the 4th century).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-nicene&#34;&gt;Post-Nicene&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All Indian Christian churches hold post-Nicene theological views which derive from an earlier church in Ctesiphon or Nisibis which in turn derives from an earlier church in Edessa/Osrhoene. Indian Christian liturgy is post 4th century and Indian Christians first show up in the historical record around the 6th century AD (Cosmas Indicopluestes).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing many people don&amp;rsquo;t entirely apprehend is that marUnmAda operates on it own &amp;ldquo;wave length&amp;rdquo;. The common considerations of a &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; player don&amp;rsquo;t entirely apply to it because it lives entirely within the unmAda.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the Abrahamistic conquest of the Europeans, despite its thoroughness, was not complete in some domains. For e.g. many European nations retained maintained fragments of old IE law &amp;amp; governance intact even after being subjugated by West Asian ekarAkShasonmAda. This is hardly so for a society engulfed by marUnmAda. It is left with only sharia &amp;amp; apparatus of mahAmada in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He is a signatory on Witzel’s infamous petition, in which the signatories pleaded ignorance to the Hindu edits, yet pledged to oppose the edits. Some media houses have been covering this subject. Wall Street Journal [WSJ] has been one of those. Deshpande was apparently upset that WSJ did not demonize the Hindus enough. He wrote a letter to the editor, where he fretted:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here’s what that means for its strategy—and for how to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;March 2015 Issue&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the Islamic State?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where did it come from, and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving, and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December, The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata, the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East, admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic State’s appeal. “We have not defeated the idea,” he said. “We do not even understand the idea.” In the past year, President Obama has referred to the Islamic State, variously, as “not Islamic” and as al-Qaeda’s “jayvee team,” statements that reflected confusion about the group, and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indologist Jason Schwartz summarizing Wagoner and Dick Eaton&amp;rsquo;s outrageous claims that are widely accepted in Occidental indology (just to be be clear I&amp;rsquo;m not endorsing it, and it is not clear if Schwartz accepts it serious himself):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A major argument of Richard Eaton and Phillip Wagoner, Power, Memory, Architecture: Contested Sites on India’s Deccan Plateau 1300-1600 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014) is that the Hindu-Muslim encounters of the early modern period need to be understood not as a clash of religions, but in terms of the complex interactions of two cultural and literary styles, that of Vijayanagara, nominally Hindu, and Sufi-inflected Persianate discourse of the Bahmani state, both of which sought to lay their claims upon the preexisting built landscapes that defined Deccani identity through its relation to the past, a past which included the cultural patrimony of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas as well as the Kākatīyas of Telangana. In this spirit, both authors point us towards what they argue was the respectful reusage of older early medieval material culture by later Deccani rulers who were both Hindu and Muslim.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He would instead command 200 million fire-breathing horsemen to massacre a third of the survivors. &amp;quot; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://indiafacts.co.in/jesus-christ-impending-genocide/#.VLE2gDlGjUZ&#34;&gt;Kalavai-jesus-genocide&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jesus was not a Yogi because he said &amp;ldquo;Kingdom of God is within you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot; As Bart Ehrman has shown (Jesus Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible, pp. 77-78), not only is the Sermon on the Mount a very late interpolation into the Bible but its message is not one of inward perfection as in the Yoga. Its message is apocalyptic; Jesus expected the end of the world to happen very soon. The verse actually means that the coming Kingdom of God is there and present among the Jewish Christians that were his contemporary followers. In this racist teaching, Gentiles are excluded from that kingdom. &amp;ldquo;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY&#34;&gt;Kalavai-201501&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The result was a dishonest book, The Kingdom of God is Within You, in which Tolstoy gave the apocalyptic Jesus a complete botox-like makeover and transformed him into a contemplative teacher who sought perfection within as a Hindu yogi does. Many unthinking Hindus, starting with Mahatma Gandhi, have popularized this propagandist story without realizing that it serves to disarm and proselytize unsuspecting  Hindus.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY&#34;&gt;Kalavai-201501&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jesus did not abrogate the troublesome 10 commandments (such as the one against image worship).

What does Jesus mean in any language? Nothing! Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Read on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jesus and his followers were all Jewish and so they had Hebrew names, although they would likely have spoken Aramaic. “J” soundw in Jesus’ name does not exist in Hebrew or Aramaic. So, the actual name is “Yehoshua”, pronounced, Yeh-ho-shoo-ah. This name is the blending of two Hebrew words:Yeh-ho + Shua. Yeh-ho = Jewish god’s name, sometimes used at the beginning or end of a Hebrew name. Shua = Hebrew word for deliverance, meaning, SAVES. Yehoshua literally means JEWISH GOD SAVES. The name Yehoshua was then cut short the same way Rajesh becomes Raju; Srinivas - Srinu; Rajeshwari - Rajjo/Raji. Thus, the 4-syllabled name Yehoshua became the 3-syllabled Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;William Jones was IMO was one of the most influential of the English. Some people answered John Woodroffe (to the question of who composed the English verses to Hindu Gods shown), not a bad choice if you guessed without cheating because his career closely parallels&amp;rsquo; Jones. I also wanted to do a segment on Jones but had to dig up some hard to find information that I finally did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both Jones and Woodroffe were judges who became sympathetic to the H tradition.Both their wives also became interested in H tradition. In the case of Woodroffe his wife made a Malhotra u-turn &amp;amp; dragged him along back to the preta-mata.+++(5)+++ I wanted to trace the case of Jones&amp;rsquo;s wife. All evidence suggests she did not waver unlike Woodroffe&amp;rsquo;s. One author has even suggested that they might have been crypto-H. Plausible - given lines in Her poem &amp;ldquo;Adieu to India&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That Xtians &amp;amp; Jews had higher growth rates isn&amp;rsquo;t much in doubt, classical authors mention it. Tacitus is explicit on Jewish growth being due to their pro natalism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How much growth over 300 yrs can never be determined now, just guesswork &amp;amp; obv Xtians have an incentive to overplay their numbers to make it out like Rome becoming Xtian was some inevitability, so I take Stark&amp;rsquo;s estimates with a pinch of salt. You can&amp;rsquo;t just indefinitely project 7 kids per women because as the groups bigger it gets harder &amp;amp; harder to swim against constraints that begin to impose themselves, just like how Iranian mullahs encouraged a baby boom during war with Iraq but then implemented family planning when they realized they couldn&amp;rsquo;t provide jobs for the youth bulge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hinduism is a minority religion in Punjab. During the Khalistan movement, the minority Hindus and Jains were subjected to several attacks. Hindu and Jain temples were frequently vandalized and desecrated. This thread documents a few instances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is to be noted that many of these incidents happened prior to the Operation Blue Star carried out by Congress Government in 1984. The attacks of Hindu temples were not confined to just Punjab. The radicals crossed over Punjab into Haryana and bombed Hindu temples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Know of its origins in this thread.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 382 CE, Jerome was commissioned to translate the old and archaic Latin versions of the bibles into everyday Latin. This was the Vulgate. Even then only the educated elite &amp;amp; priests could read it. They acted like mediators between believers and the Christian god, reading and interpreting it for the common people. Now we know how and why so many interpretations arose out of each verse. This gave them scope to corruption within the church. This went on till the 1500s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;sanskrit-vs-farsi&#34;&gt;Sanskrit vs Farsi&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The entry of Persian into India was mostly due to it being the court / official language of a great Muslim kings. It was &amp;ldquo;high culture&amp;rdquo; for them (even if they were ethnic turks). This is how India got the camp language (urdu) with its heavy use of farsi and arabic loan words. Common soldiers in the camps had to converse with the farsi spouting nobility.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To quote &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sandeepweb.com/2012/11/27/coming-soon-an-entitlement-university-named-after-a-mass-murderer/&#34;&gt;Sandeep&lt;/a&gt;:  &amp;ldquo;Kannada was the official language of the Mysore state when the Wodeyar dynasty ruled over the Mysore kingdom…When Tipu took over, he changed the administrative language from Kannada to Farsi. We can witness this till date. Karnataka Government’s land and revenue records use Farsi terminology. For instance, a usage like “Ramesh’s son Suresh” is written as “Suresh bin Ramesh.” Our state has retained terms like “Khata,” “Khirdi,” “Pahani,” “Khanesuvari,” “Gudasta,” and “Baranamoona,” a direct holdover from Tipu’s times. Not just that—Tipu changed the names of entire cities and towns: Brahmapuri became Sultanpet, Kallikote became Farookabad, Chitradurga became Farook yab Hissar, Coorg became Zafarabad, Devanahalli became Yusufabad, Dinigul became Khaleelabad, Gutti became Faiz Hissar, Krishnagiri became Phalk-il-azam, Mysore became Nazarabad, Penukonda became Fakrabad, Sankridurga became Muzaffarabad, Sira became Rustumabad, and Sakleshpur became Manjarabad…Muslims in Malabar speak, read and write Malayalam even today just as Tamil Muslims in Tamil Nadu read, write and speak in Tamil. Thanks to Tipu, Muslims in Karnataka speak only Urdu. This is the direct result of Tipu’s insistence that Farsi and Urdu were the only permitted mediums of instruction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;limited-sanskrit-patronage&#34;&gt;Limited sanskrit patronage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some Muslim rulers did patronize Sanskrit scholars and poets, if only to record history and songs of praise, communicate with their hindu subjects.

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Westerners who study Indian Languages as a full time profession are almost always subversionists, well integrated in the anti India ecosystem. Sadly they get too much limelight and support, way disproportionate to the worth of their scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I keep saying that in hierarchy of identities language should be below religion. Hence, delighting in poetry or grammar or linguistics is for me at an entirely lower level than the religious content presented in that medium. I take an even more drastic position that linguistics for linguistics sake is quite an empty exercise.+++(4)+++ It takes value only when it is a tool for cracking philological issues pertaining to the root culture of the language. Let us not forget that were not far from a Sanskrit speaking sultanate under the ghaznavids or have a Shaiste Khan spout a delicate vasantatilaka on the shapeliness of one of his begam-s below the burka that would get the Sanskritists nodding approvingly on the demonstration of vyAkaraNa &amp;amp; vR^itta. But Shaiste remains a Shaiste. The holiness the language comes from containing the first praises of the gods by our ancestors rather from something intrinsic to itself. Even if that were so it comes from identification of the phonemes with the deities.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Discussions have now become a matter of routine in a political sense. The mid-nineties saw a wide cleavage in Tamil - Muslim relationships resulting in the driving out of the Muslims from the north; there can be no doubt about their re- settlement. But, at the same time, during the same period, the Eastern Province too witnessed similar events; the Tamils living in their traditional regions too were driven out of their homes by Muslims: displacement to other areas etc. In that context, there is the necessity to take into consideration the plight of such displaced Tamils too to be re-settled in their areas earlier occupied by them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We have been fighting for no other reason than to extract people from their kufr (unbelief) and to usher them into the fold of Islam.” The commander also had a message for Yazidis who have not converted to Islam: “We advise, or even beseech, the Yazidis to come down from the mountains and convert, first and foremost in order to save their souls from the Hellfire, and secondly, if they remain in the mountains, they will die of hunger and thirst.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;KE: &amp;ldquo;Thus, when Mohammed Atta, Mohammed Bouyeri and hundreds of other Muslim terrorists declare in their farewell letters/videos that their motive is Islam, we have to believe them. But when they talk about Islam, claiming that their own interpretation is the same as Prophet Mohammed’s, we have to ascertain for ourselves the truth of that claim. And then we find that Prophet Mohammed’s intention was indeed closer to al-Qaeda’s than to that of the Sufis, a movement which invokes Quranic authority but was quite unknown in Mohammed’s day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Article by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newindianexpress.com/columns/Skewed-logic-of-Al-Qaeda/2013/09/18/article1789874.ece&#34;&gt;Tufail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Former terrorist and ex-muslim Maajid Nawaz&amp;rsquo;s interviews: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlADwwnipaI&#34;&gt;Islamism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharia-enforcement&#34;&gt;Sharia enforcement&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ridiculous fatwas (judicial opinions of mullah-s/ ulema-s) continue to be issued [See&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iVIec5e3_0&amp;amp;feature&#34;&gt;Arun Shourie&amp;rsquo;s take&lt;/a&gt;] around the muslim world. Yes, this &amp;ldquo;high literature&amp;rdquo; does influence the lives and attitudes of muslims.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Examples: Opinions on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty-q9GTure4&#34;&gt;beating women&lt;/a&gt;, sex slaves (Details in a separate section).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sharia policing within (even minority) muslim communities and neighborhoods.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Societies such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablighi_Jamaat&#34;&gt;Tablighi Jamat&lt;/a&gt; (India) enforce retrograde mores among the muslim ummah.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dw.de/locals-concerned-as-sharia-police-patrol-streets-of-german-city/a-17904887&#34;&gt;German city&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-moving-beyond-bad-theology-difficult-in-islam&#34;&gt;Why is moving beyond bad theology difficult in Islam?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Islam is historicentric - very much reliant on the deeds and words of a historical person (rather than a deity), Muhammad - whose existence is not questioned by believers.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An ideology centered around this ideal muslim (&amp;ldquo;muhammad ul rasUl allaH&amp;rdquo;), a historic person, is fundamentally flawed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mythic elements are rather weak - unlike in Hinduisms, where we have an abundance of talking monkeys, bears and eagles, set in a mythic age. So, it is much harder to challenge the emulation-worthiness of the deeds of Muhammad.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The best case:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Muslims can say that slavery is not legitimate now, and that crucifixion is wrong at this historical juncture. Many say precisely this. But they cannot condemn slavery or crucifixion outright without contradicting the Koran and the example of the Prophet. &amp;hellip; That really would be an act of apostasy.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/&#34;&gt;ISIS_A&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Islam is highly text-centric: There is no part of their holy texts which declare that it is important to move beyond the texts [check].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Later verses have precedence over earlier verses in Quran (&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/vKXGcZlMK_k?t=1132&#34;&gt;vid&lt;/a&gt;), in traditional Islam. So, the mostly-Meccan peace-verses are abrogated by the Medina intolerance-verses. Eg: &amp;ldquo;No compulsion in religion&amp;rdquo; vs verse of the sword.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To judge RoP (religion of peace/ Islam) by its holy texts:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Muhammad is the ideal muslim. (Anyone blaspheming him is going to be in deep trouble in almost any muslim country.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Muhammad was a lecherous person, slaver and a mass murderer - making him a horrible human according to some. (Look at his life stories, starting with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Qurayza&#34;&gt;banu qurayza&lt;/a&gt; massacre.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;homosexuality&#34;&gt;Homosexuality&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Like other Abe&amp;rsquo;s madnesses, classical Islam considers homosexuality a sin.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ottoman Sheikhulislam Ebu Su&amp;rsquo;ud effendi (d. 1574), who served as the grand mufti of the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Suleyman (d. 1566), distinguished between sodomy with &amp;lsquo;men&amp;rsquo; (rijal) and with youths&amp;rsquo; (ghilman), the violations of the former motivating God&amp;rsquo;s condemnation of the people of Lot (el-Rouayheb, 2005, p. 126). This variation emphasizes a much discussed differential based on maturity indicating that sex with a pre-pubescent ghilman boy fell in many cases outside the purview of the law. In the Muslim religious tradition, it was when the people of Lot began sodomizing adult males that they were punished, leaving room for the interpretation that it was only sex between adult men that was condemned.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That is because non-Muslims are necessarily inferior to Muslims in the Islamic scheme of things. If they actually do they should strive to convert that country into a Muslim majority country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is not to deny the positive contribution and truly objective scholarship of some western academics towards the understanding of Hindu past and Hindu nationalism. Yet, we Hindus have shown ourselves to be internally capable of doing all this, and the subversive actions do stand out as a liability.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Western academic setup also includes Indians trained in and beholden to that system.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This list does not excuse shoddy research, bad presentation and bad behavior by some Hindu-s.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eg. Koenraad Elst on NS Rajaram in 2014 &lt;a href=&#34;http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2014/02/what-have-i-done-2.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, Rajaram reviewing unread books &lt;a href=&#34;http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2014/04/rajaram-witzel-and-racism.html&#34;&gt;KE14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;These Hindu noise makers have contributed to our defeat in the past (eg. 2005 California Textbook &lt;a href=&#34;http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2013/10/hindu-noise-makers.html&#34;&gt;KE10&lt;/a&gt;.)&#xA;(Not-so) Unique features of western Indologist approach (Summaries: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/speaking-in-gods-tongue-the-grammar-of-sanskrit-scholarship-today/&#34;&gt;Rohana19&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-gathering-despite-terrible-narratives&#34;&gt;Data gathering despite terrible narratives&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;They are terrible, absolutely terrible at narratives but their footnotes &amp;amp; research, “pure facts” so to say are unparalleled.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;That is the sole reason I read any of these dveṣīs’ works. Full of references&amp;hellip;. their data collection is fantastic &amp;amp; rigorous. The “big picture” conclusions, the narratives as you put it, are going to be shitty as the shiftiness is deliberate &amp;amp; by design.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;scientific-evidence-over-traditional-beliefs&#34;&gt;Scientific evidence over traditional beliefs&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stuff like Patanjali of mahAbhAShya being different from patanjali of yogasUtra.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And, ability to use IE linguistics tools to interpret veda-s : &amp;quot; a recent project completed in the US – with the involvement of Stephanie Jamison (b. 1948) from UCLA, a big name in the field of Western Sanskrit scholarship – was on translating the Rgveda, oldest Sanskrit text, into English, with the help of Indo-European linguistics rather than slavishly depending on Indian hermeneutics as many Indian scholars did so far. &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

An idol is not the God, mythology is not the God. But they do connect people to the God. A cult arises when a God is worshiped in a particular context, place, time, way, purpose. Santa Muerte is death, something undeniably real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting more into this topic, as it is one of the major things that distinguishes paganism from Judaism. Judaism started as a project to do away with all this context. This was to do away with and prevent the founding of new cults. It didn&amp;rsquo;t start as monotheism but one temple ism. Monolatry doesn&amp;rsquo;t filly describe it either, as it isn&amp;rsquo;t just the worship of one God, but in one place, in one way, with one priesthood. This was very unusual, the only thing prior that even approached this was Akhenaten, he may have had this in mind for his new capital city. It effectively locked the vast majority of people from even worshiping yahweh most of the time. And even if they went to Jerusalem to do so they mainly served the role of buying a sacrificial animal and handing it to the priests. Who often sold the animals in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;find-inter-school-rivalries&#34;&gt;Find inter-school rivalries&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do we understand by contextualizing the texts? Lineal conflicts and personal attacks that developed into prolonged clashes between the gurukulas, for instance. And the scribal errors purported to be as such but purposely employed devices to alter meaning or variants resulting from the popularity of the text in vernacular traditions. Even beneath an ostentatious eulogy, we may decipher a lamentation if carefully gone against the grain by following the paronomastic hints or “slesharthas“. Some Indian pundits in early modern India, as we get to know now, produced perverted commentaries of Sanskrit texts in order to elude harsh polemics, win patronage, or take revenge on the gurukula such texts belonged to. &amp;quot; (&amp;lt;&amp;mdash; What is he talking about in each sentence here? Of course, mAdhva-Appayya rivalry is an example of the first. But the rest? One also wonders if this &amp;ldquo;gutter inspector&amp;rdquo; role is something to be celebrated.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These narratives were written by Ghulam Hasan Samin and translated into English by William Irvine in the vol. 36 of Indian Antiquary in 1907. The details are gory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Mathura, they did mass scale killing of Hindu ascetics. They killed cows as well and tied the severed head of the cows around the neck of killed ascetics in a way that dead cow&amp;rsquo;s head touched the mouth of slain ascetics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the core? Not the likes of the following, since hindus themselves make many such mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ridiculous translations from the Clay series brought out by Mr Pollock and co, arising from shaky grounding in Indian thought - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/suhasm/status/705307611630014464&#34;&gt;TW16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;consequences&#34;&gt;Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;These dry/ context-free scholars have tended to influence (very actively or otherwise) how Hindu traditions are summarized or presented to Hindus and non-hindu-s alike. Eg. The California case.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[To be edited.] Casting pro-hindutva people as fools (while deliberately ignoring savants on the hindutva side).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Subversion of the sikh-s by Max Arthur Macauliffe [&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/609722130368888832&#34;&gt;T1&lt;/a&gt;].&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Abrahamized the sikhs even more.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Invented pro-british fake prophesies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Plenty are books produced by western Indologists and their acolytes which have attempted or inadvertently tended to subvert Hindu traditions with inimical narratives.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hindu reviews site: &lt;a href=&#34;http://hindureview.com/author/vishalagarwal/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vishal Agarwal&amp;rsquo;s review of Wendy Doniger&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Hindus: An Alternative History&amp;rdquo; : &lt;a href=&#34;http://smile.amazon.com/review/R15O4GR4A5HABO?sa-no-redirect=1&#34;&gt;AM10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Early Indological work was heavily motivated by Evangelism.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eg: The Monier-Williams / Max Muller race.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Imputing flawed racist narratives.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Prof. George Thompson on kRShNa (&lt;a href=&#34;http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2012/04/george-thompson-as-case-study-in-racist.html&#34;&gt;KE12&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robert Goldman: &amp;ldquo;The perverted man who compared the expansion of Hanuman to the erection of a flaccid phallus.

Witzel&amp;rsquo;s congradulatory 2005 letter &lt;a href=&#34;https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/07/15/sampling-from-indologist-subversion-during-the-2005-california-textbook-fight/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where he next plans to target BBC.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Strategic errors on the Hindu side:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2013/10/hindu-noise-makers.html&#34;&gt;KE10&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot; So, when in 2005 the school textbooks in California came up for review, two Hindu organizations proposed a series of edits to the chapter on Hinduism. Some were uncontroversial, e.g. replacing the photograph of a mosque with the caption &amp;ldquo;Hindu temple&amp;rdquo; by the photograph of a proper Hindu temple. Some were cases of intra-Hindu infighting, e.g. replacing the philosophical &amp;ldquo;self-realization&amp;rdquo; as the goal of Hinduism with the devotional &amp;ldquo;God-realization&amp;rdquo;. Outsiders who took an interest in this, could have an opinion on this, but it was not serious enough to warrant interference. But when Hindus proposed that &amp;ldquo;the Aryan Invasion Theory is wrong&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;nobody believes in it anymore&amp;rdquo;, a revolutionary c.q. a plainly wrong statement, this alerted a number of Hindu-bashing groups including several academics with a say in the Aryan question. What followed was procedurally not very kosher, with the academics gate-crashing into the debate with a very partisan stance being accepted by the educational authorities as arbiters to a controversy which they themselves had started. &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2016 CA textbook fight&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/12/scholars-who-study-hinduism-and-india-face-hostile-climate&#34;&gt;IHE16&lt;/a&gt;05 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vamsee-juluri/the-la-times-lied-about-i_b_9657472.html&#34;&gt;HP1605&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Indian textbook subversion.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Misrepresentation of Ancient India and Hinduism&lt;br&gt;&#xA;in American School Textbooks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[History Today (Journal of the Indian History and Culture Society, New Delhi), Vol. VII, 2005-2006, pp. 72-89]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Vishal Agarwal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(With inputs from Hindu Education Foundation and The Vedic Foundation)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;10-academic-hinduphobia-and-american-school-textbooks&#34;&gt;1.0 Academic Hinduphobia and American School Textbooks&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have demonstrated the prevalence of strong bias towards the history of Ancient India leading to Hinduphobia at all academic levels in the United States.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Strangely, bias of this kind is missing from the books which besides Hinduism also deal with Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Due to this researchers specializing in pedagogy have noted that children from Indian or Hindu heritage often feel ashamed of their identity as a result of this prejudice.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Several middle school students,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or adult second-generation Indian Americans,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who had studied about India and Hinduism in their younger years in American schools, have complained that they suffered adverse psychological effects. Parents of such children have also spoken out about the problems that they faced when their children came home, feeling traumatized (‘Will I be burned on my husband’s pyre?’), insulted and slighted, and declared that they want to disown their own heritage (‘I do not want to be a Hindu’).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Some Indian parents have approached schools and education boards in the United States on their own to offer alternate course material and classes in an effort to counter this negative propaganda.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The results of such initiatives have been mixed so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monarchism has a terrible risk - Constantine effect. (Competent but anti-religious man at the top can destroy you beyond recovery.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hence, grudgingly, we may need to favor democracy - albeit with a severely restricted electorate (eg. initiated Aryas educated in the dharmashAstras).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jan Assmann, &amp;ldquo;Monotheism and its Political Consequences&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This border, the distinction between true and false or good and evil with regard to religion is the proper innovation of monotheism&amp;hellip; There were no idols and heathen in the realm of tribal religion and polytheism. The construction of paganism is the single achievement of monotheism, based on the distinction between true and false. Monotheism, therefore, is a religion that blurs boundaries, the boundaries that are expressed or represented by the divinities of polytheism between cities and countries, tribes and nations, day and night, land and sea, love and war, good and evil&amp;ndash; but that also erects a boundary: between true and false, religion and idolatry. Monotheism is, at the same time, exclusive and universalistic. Both tendencies, the exclusive and the universalistic, have political consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, Multicultural Hindutva&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is déjà vu time for battle-scarred scholars of Indian history, who have scarcely recovered from their long and bitter fight against the &amp;ldquo;saffronization&amp;rdquo; of textbooks in India. Only, the new battleground is far-away California.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is déjà vu time for battle-scarred scholars of Indian history, who have scarcely recovered from their long and bitter fight against the &amp;ldquo;saffronization&amp;rdquo; of textbooks in India. Only, the new battleground is far-away California, where the Sangh Parivar is making a concerted effort to achieve through sixth grade history textbooks all that it had failed to achieve in India through the NCERT. Ironically, an ideology that derides the very notion of a composite culture in India is now shamelessly resorting to the language of multiculturalism in the U.S. to advance its sectarian agenda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From: &lt;strong&gt;Professor Nathan Katz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sent: Tuesday, November 29, 2005 11:38 AM via email&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Subject:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Baker,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am writing with reference to proposed curricular changes regarding Hinduism and Indian history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have looked briefly at the proposed changes, as well as the objections to those changes posed by a small group of American academicians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not have the time to respond point-by-point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there are two broader issues involved. The first is who determines what is and what is not taught, as well as who speaks with authority about a religious or cultural tradition. On the one hand, we might say that modern scholars ought to have the last word. However, when these scholars are overwhelming not from the religious tradition being studied, one must wonder as to the propriety of outsiders having such a privileged position.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interesting graphs in this article by Haidt +++(showing sharp rise in mental problems in liberal kids and youth)+++. While Haidt himself likes to play equal-equal it illustrates why we call navyonmAda an unmAda. Ultimately we believe that just like the West Asian unmAda-s, the American unmAda has 2 fold epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are the biological unmatta who spark off a local navyonmAda event like a rAkShasavAdin. These are foci of the infection &amp;ndash; we can with high fidelity just look at the face +++(→ ugliness??)+++ &amp;amp; predict if a person is going to be a navyonmatta before they announce their sarvanAmani &amp;ndash; a sign that a mahAmlechCha is nayvonmatta.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/GhorAngirasa/status/1974378024754712662&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A subtle point to note is how Xtians like to use the idea of “concessions” when they encounter something unsavoury or unpalatable in their scriptures. A few examples follow:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ritual-sacrifice-shift&#34;&gt;Ritual sacrifice shift&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yahuda sacrificial system in Vayikra (Leviticus) under the “old covenant” obviously resembled that found in Near-Eastern polytheisms. Xtian theologians often point out that these rituals were a concession &amp;amp; were done away with under the new covenant under Jesus, who performs the final and ultimate sacrifice with himself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t make much sense. If one is making a concession and is merely tolerating a certain state of affairs, why would he express a particular preference for certain aromas? Why dedicate so many rules to what he wants from each type of sacrifice. Concessions suggest a minimalistic approach, which does not square with the level of detail accorded to the sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Alex Belios?)+++ and Cambridge University found out about his books on mathematics in Hindi, visited him, asked him questions, and then said that &amp;ldquo;if there is 1% mathematics elsewhere in the world, there is 100% mathematics in Govardhan Math&amp;rdquo;. Carl Sagan once said, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. There is zero evidence offered for the claim by the Swami. The mathematicians are not named, the dates are not mentioned, and their questions are not shared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The honour of Islām demands the humiliation of the infidels and their false religion. To achieve this objective, jizyah should be mercilessly levied upon them, and they should be treated like dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-Cows should be slaughtered to demonstrate the supremacy of Islām. The performance of this rite is, in India, the most important symbol of Islamic domination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdlNIJB9ZVU&#34;&gt;J Lindsay 20&lt;/a&gt;. They seek to warp the perception of reality in terms of oppressors and oppressed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The can spin a favored oppression angle in any situation. Example - &amp;ldquo;White man and Black man walk to a tailor shop. Attend to white person first? Racist. Attend to black person first? Racist because you want to get rid of him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rooted in marxist concept of &amp;ldquo;conflict theory&amp;rdquo; of fundamental conflict between classes. Could be bourgeoisie vs proletariat or white vs black lives, male patriarchy vs women, hetero-normative straight culture vs sexual minorities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s now all about having the power to assert that in fact you are powerless, and therefore immune to criticism&amp;rdquo; - RK.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, runs counter to hindu ethos:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their view of the tradition is purely as a training routine, and propagation as purely biological. Their psychological drive comes from a set of inward-looking concepts that I will come to later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;haredi-and-zionism&#34;&gt;Haredi and Zionism&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Haredi view Zionism as blasphemous sacrilege that is trying to establish a Jewish state without the sanction of Yahweh. Haredi believe the Jews have been cursed by Yahweh to be a stateless people until the  Messiah comes. Think of them as Shrautin Agnihotris of Jews.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Or, they may be viewed as mentally ill polytheists, who have (in their heads) turned ALL Gods into demons - including their - now psychotic - &amp;ldquo;One True God&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some gallant actions by soldiers under Chief of Military Staff, Brigadier Rajender Singh Jamwal delayed the jihadi raiders by two crucial days. The Brigadier attained veergati and was the first recipient of Maha Vir Chakra for being the savior of Kashmir.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But when they talk about Islam, claiming that their own interpretation is the same as Prophet Mohammed’s, we have to ascertain for ourselves the truth of that claim. And then we find that Prophet Mohammed’s intention was indeed closer to al-Qaeda’s than to that of the Sufis, a movement which invokes Quranic authority but was quite unknown in Mohammed’s day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;pan-islamic-caliphate&#34;&gt;Pan-Islamic Caliphate&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Choudary’s colleague Abu Baraa explained that Islamic law permits only temporary peace treaties, lasting no longer than a decade. Similarly, accepting any border is anathema, as stated by the Prophet and echoed in the Islamic State’s propaganda videos. If the caliph consents to a longer-term peace or permanent border, he will be in error. Temporary peace treaties are renewable, but may not be applied to all enemies at once: the caliph must wage jihad at least once a year. He may not rest, or he will fall into a state of sin.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/&#34;&gt;ISIS1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The caliph is required to implement Sharia.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;judging-non-superficially&#34;&gt;Judging non-superficially&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us put it this way – with “Skin in the game” to keep it real. Even an impartial neutral non-hindu atheist might see the point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would one, as a father of two young Hindu girls, want to live in the midst of a muslim neighborhood (punjabi, bangla, moplah, kashmiri take your pick)? A burmese buddhist neighborhood? A Balinese Hindu neighborhood? A vietnamese buddhist neighborhood?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The muslims can eat all of the same chicken Tikka masala and the Vietnamese can eat all the cocroaches they catch. But, at the end of the day, what matters far more are some shared gurantees and outlook. In other words, “more in common” is not a simple average – but a weighted complex mean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In Cochin, Syrian Christian prelates participated in the installation ceremonies of the rulers. During the premier Kerala festival, Onam, part of the regalia for the rituals was stored in a Cochin Syrian Christian church. The procession carrying the Hindu deity, Krishna, at that festival was expected by custom to make a brief stop at the home of a prominent Syrian Christian family who had contributed to the cost of financing that procession. The high status of the Syrian Christians in Hindu society was reflected everywhere by their right of access to Hindu society was reflected everywhere by their right of access to Hindu shrines and ‘sacred space’. In Alleppey, a newly emerging urban center in Tranvancore, during the eighteenth country, a Hindu temple and a Syrian Christian church were built on adjoining sites, a practice found in the case of older churches and temples in places such as Niranom, Chengannur, Kallopara, and Parur between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Christians continued to use Hindu style torches, umbrellas, and banners at their festivals to honor saints and bishops of the Syrian church. There was at least one Hindu temple that lent its temple elephants for Syrian Christian festival processions.&amp;rdquo; [Gheverghese &lt;a href=&#34;http://centreright.in/2012/09/the-syrian-christians-of-kerala-part-1/comment-page-1/#.VLMfADlGjUY&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;prominent-betrayal-by-syrian-christians&#34;&gt;Prominent betrayal by Syrian Christians:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They welcomed British Christian rule, did not support independence struggle and organized to subvert local hindu hierarchy.

Later, as history records, Tipu was defeated during his invasion of Travancore and was forced to retreat back to Mysore, where he eventually met his end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even after the fall of Tipu and British take over of Malabar,  many Moplahs remained as radical fanatics. They kept attacking Hindus and trying to convert them into islam. There were many such clashes between Hindus and Moplahs – always initiated by latter. These series of clashes finally lead to the 1921 genocide of Malabar Hindus, where thousands of Hindus were killed and several more were made to flee the region and numerous Hindu temples were destroyed by Moplah fanatics. It is a well recorded fact that the Hindus also retaliated against their attacks. Kalliat Nambiars for instance took out the Moplah fanatics who attacked their household [9]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So, it is best to fight and minimize this disease as much as possible.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better connection to the universe, better care for our environment, more creativity (via greater freedom and superior access to truly divine inspiration), less energy spent on proselytization that uproots people from their ancestral cults &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Intolerance for intolerance is essential - anything else is suicidal. More in &lt;a href=&#34;../../../polity/external-affairs/tolerance/&#34;&gt;tolerance page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;You live in a world of multiplicity. Multiplicity is inherent in just you alone, a single being; with multiple limbs, organs, sensory faculties, etc. Multiplicity in colours, tastes, smells, etc. Why won’t there be a multiplicity on the divine? Polytheism recognises this ubiquitousness of multiplicity &amp;amp; offers you a way to access this divine multiplicity in this very mundane world through these very mundane things. Suddenly, the 8 directions of the compass, colours, shapes, etc have something transcendental to offer. Monotheism only offers you a gloomy, empty &amp;amp; sinful world and a permanently displeased singularity of “God”, outside whom there is no choice to access the divine as per one’s proclivities and nature. You have to be a very insipid/dry human being to be a monotheist.&amp;rdquo; - GA.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do Protestants disown the Tanakh (Old Testament) claiming, the only part that they have anything to do with it is the so-called prophecy of Jesus mentioned in Isaiah 7:14? That is because even they find most of the contents absurd, indecent, sexual, graphic, so on. Talking snake &amp;amp; donkey told as historical events, their god&amp;rsquo;s mandate to kill babies, his act of drowning innocent animals, his curse to dash infants to the ground, rip open pregnant wombs are too absurd &amp;amp; violent to the modern minds. And so the best thing to do is disown it. But as masters at cherry picking, they pick the so-called prophesy because it justifies Christianity&amp;rsquo;s dominion theology. It is the Christian political ideology of establishing a Christian world nation in the name of saving the world from damnation through the grace of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A lot of the British &amp;ldquo;rationalism&amp;rdquo; and consequently neo-Enlightenment thought in the Occident (and its apers elsewhere in the world, like India) is best explained as emerging from the pretamata&amp;rsquo;s anxiety over phenomena or systems that might challenge their sole right to special authority. E.g., the only accepted supernaturalism was that of the church.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the early English &amp;ldquo;rationalism&amp;rdquo; directed against things like poltergeists and ghosts and such like phenomena was not due to a fundamentally scientific challenge but because they intruded into to domain assigned solely to the ekarAkShasa by the pretAlaya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On reactions to Audrey Truschke&amp;rsquo;s rants It&amp;rsquo;s disappointing most counters come from H-Right. Her fellow indologists of repute don&amp;rsquo;t take her on, which reduces H-trust in them E.g. Edwin Bryant works in the same university as Audrey. You don&amp;rsquo;t see him taking her on Indologists often complain about how H-side is too much into conspiracy theories, and disrespectful of academia, mainstream scholarship etc But you don&amp;rsquo;t help matters with your selective outrage and silence H&amp;rsquo;s loss of faith in the system is understandable. It is v evident there is tribalism at work and maybe even a covert form of racism - Where nonsense that is critical of Hindus is tolerated and even tacitly encouraged by those who ought to know better, While nonsense that emanates from Hindus is picked on with alacrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lafcadio Hearn reports on June 1, 1893 about Christians targeting Japanese kids for conversion by giving them money &amp;amp; trying to buy land (many Japanese even those in poverty refused to sell) to set up missions&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Postwar Japan: Japanese who did convert to Christianity were derisively called &amp;ldquo;rice Christians&amp;rdquo; by other Japanese. The derogatory nickname implied that missionaries provided material or financial benefit as inducement to converts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan - people at that time called Catholciism &amp;ldquo;powdered milkism&amp;rdquo; (naifenjiao) or &amp;ldquo;flourism&amp;rdquo; (mianfenjiao).77 And the Church was known as the &amp;ldquo;flour church.&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; Although most of Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s population rejoiced in its newfound prosperity&amp;hellip; not everyone on the island found these processes comforting.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Twitter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tendency that we see among many Muslims in the Indian subcontinent today to identify more with Islamic traditions from the Middle East than the culture they are from has its roots in the colonial period. In the medieval period, except for elite ashrafs, the people from +lower castes/ classes who converted to Islam often retained aspects of their Hindu culture. The fashioning of Muslim political identity began in earnest from 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dhananjay Mahapatra / TNN /  2018&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the recent past, political leaders have made visits to temples an inseparable part of their election campaign itinerary and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Framers of the Constitution kept religion and politics separate. The Constitution mandates secularism as the cardinal principle of governance. But ground level politics has always tried to mix the two to form a potent vote catching chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the chasm between communities widening, thanks to competing sectarian politics, there is a section of the intelligentsia which advises politicians to adopt a soft Hinduism line rather than advocate Hindutva, mistaking it for fanatic Hinduism, especially after the advent of cow vigilante groups. It is another matter that most states enacted laws banning cow slaughter in the 1960s when ‘cow and calf ’ was the election symbol of a political party.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All Sikh Gurus came from one caste - Khatri and largely their children also married within their own community. If it was so egalitarian then why this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;caste-strictures&#34;&gt;Caste strictures&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SCs were barred from Golden Temple. The Mazhabis (SC) were forbidden to enter the Golden Temple for worship; their offering of karah prasad was not accepted and the Sikhs denied them access to public wells and other utilities. Khalsa Dharam Sastrar of 1914 laid down that the members of the untouchable groups (like the Mazhabi, Rahtia and Ramdasia Sikhs) did not have the right to go beyond the fourth step in the Golden Temple. The members of the fourfold varnas including Nai, Chippe, Jhivar, were instructed not to mix with persons belonging to the untouchable castes. Those who were guilty of breaking caste rules were classified as &amp;lsquo;patit&amp;rsquo; and shunned by the Sikh civil society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They both fused the current state of Sufism back into ulema-centered Islam. Imam Rabbani popularized the theology of “wahdat ash-shahood” - oneness of witnessing. This is a lame misappropriation of Vishishtadvaita, whose Ramanandi proponents were active in the area around where Sirhindi grew up. This reductionistic plagiarism was subhanallah’ed. Just as “wahdat al-wajood” is a reductionistic image of Advaita, Rabbani’s school is of Vishishtadvaita.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Do this not only when they are watching you, because you want to gain their approval; but with all your heart do what God wants, as slaves of Christ. Do your work as slaves cheerfully, as though you served the Lord, and not merely human beings.”—Ephesians 6:5-7&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/tapeshyadav_usa/status/2010567356813078775&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bilingual Inscription at Somnath&#xA;1264 AD, Arabic + Sanskrit ➡️ historic deception&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somnath fell and rose again many times, this is well known. Less known: Muslims thrived near Somnath between the destructions, asked for accommodation, sometimes deceptively. This 🧵 gives an example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nākhudā Nūruddin Fīrūz was a rich shipmaster from Hormuz. In the 13th century, he came with a plea to Chalukya-Vaghela king Arjunadeva. He spoke to leading Hindus. Asked for accommodation and permission. He bought land and shops in rebuilt Somnath-Patan (Veraval). Near the great temple.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fīrūz built a mosque and left a bilingual inscription. Dated Ramaḍān AH 662 and Vikram Samvat 1320 – that is, 1264 AD. It records the treaty. It lists gifts for the upkeep of mosque. It names the witnesses. And&amp;hellip; a deception.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Sanskrit text (longer, 43 lines) speaks to Hindus. It opens with praise of Shiva – Vishwanatha, Sunyarupa, Visvarupa. It flatters the king. It notes the treaty in plain words. It mentions lamps, oil, water for the mosque. It shows courtesy. It respects the hosts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Arabic text (28 lines) speaks to Muslims. It begins with praise of Allah. It skips Shiva. It skips the Hindu king. It honors the Sultan of Hormuz. It explicitly says: “May Allah make this city of Somnath one of the cities of Islam. May He banish infidelity and idols.” It quotes: “Only he shall inhabit God’s places of worship who believes in Allah and the Last Day, performs prayer, pays zakat, and fears none but Allah alone.” And so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Same witnesses. Same gifts. Very different tone. Very different aims. Bilingual yes, but entirely different message, hopes and appeal. The bilingual slabs stood together for centuries. Later they were split. One went to a Hindu temple. One to another mosque.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Marxist scholars and apologists explain this away as a &amp;ldquo;political&amp;rdquo; need. Muslims were few then. They couldn&amp;rsquo;t say their true desire, they had to adapt.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Others see the five deception doctrines at work, doctrines born in the Middle East, 8th–13th centuries: Taqiyya, Kitman, Tawriya, Mudara, K&amp;rsquo;hida.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

However, despite its lofty goal of resisting colonial domination, it was fundamentally constrained politically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Burning alive the missionary&amp;rsquo;s two sons (aged 10 and 6) does not help the H cause, imho. (Some claim that DS was not guilty, but the ppl supporting him on the web assume that he was and celebrate him for it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are the exact events detailed somewhere? I imagine Graham would&amp;rsquo;ve been warned to get out (and face death) or his vehicle would be burned with kids. Did he reject possibility of kids being spared and keep them inside? Christian martyrdom fetish is why Japs invented tsurushi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;orthodoxy-on-fundamental-islamic-tenets&#34;&gt;Orthodoxy on fundamental Islamic tenets.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Carl informs: &amp;ldquo;In Islamic philosophy, ahadiyyat refers to the &amp;lsquo;Uniqueness&amp;rsquo; of Allah, and occurs commonly in very fundamental surahs like Ikhlas. Wahdaniyyat refers to the &amp;lsquo;Oneness&amp;rsquo; of reality.&amp;rdquo; Theologians like Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi used these two concepts in his formulation of an epistemological Wahdat-ash-Shuhood (oneness of creator and created only in the eyes of the witnesser) as opposed to the older ontological formulation of Wahdat-ul-Wujood (oneness of existence; ie creater and created are one). Wahdat-ul-Wujood might have permitted monism, polytheism or pantheism - but it has been opposed vehemently by islamic orthodoxy (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpUw5U5SYjU&#34;&gt;Muhammad Salah video&lt;/a&gt;). Most ideologues who do openly accept it take great pains to clarify that this does not deviate from the intolerant shariah.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jews very deliberately study and strategize for their survival.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eg. UK-demography &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jpr.org.uk/publications/tag.demography&#34;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Considering to the rise of India and China &lt;a href=&#34;http://isteve.blogspot.ca/2010/07/china-v-india-which-will-be-good-for.html&#34;&gt;IS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Shalom Wald [&lt;a href=&#34;http://bookzz.org/book/2493368/cfbd55&#34;&gt;bookz&lt;/a&gt;], who &amp;ldquo;chose 14 well-known historians, from Thucydides to Gibbon, Spangler, Toynbee and Kennedy, and examined their theories concerning the circumstances in which civilizations flourish or collapse. Then he tried to examine how these theories can be applied to the context of the Jewish people.&amp;rdquo; One major recommendation was that Jews do not concentrate entirely in Israel - it is not the best survival strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

According to the regional Hindu tradition, the temple was built on the spot where Lava and Kusha bound Hanuman. The temple annually attracts millions of Hindus from all over the country. Amristsar has a very ancient Hindu history. According to the regional Hindu tradition recorded in the &amp;ldquo;Survey of Amritsar&amp;rdquo;, Amritsar got its name from Amrit immersed by Lava and Kusha in a pond.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Muslims and Christians deliberately chose pagan sites to assert the supremacy of their religion over paganism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built atop a Temple of Venus built by Hadrian.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nor is there any evidence that the Temple of Venus was venerated by Christians as the site of Golgotha prior to Helena&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;vision.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Kaaba in Mecca was a pagan shrine with 360 idols.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no historical evidence that Abraham or Ishmael even existed, let alone that they built the Kaaba in Mecca.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Likewise, the Mexico City Cathedral was built with the stones of the Aztec Templo Mayor.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, two of the holiest sites of Christianity and Islam are rooted in predatory usurpation of pagan sites that was retroactively justified on pseudo-historical grounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yet he was the most prolific philologist of the Indian tradition without having ever set foot in the country. He achieved this because he had a sound method, extraordinary capacity and honesty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He converts entire villages.&amp;rdquo; -Letter from Nana Phadnis to Mahadji Scindia, 5 September 1784.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Further, sources reveal that 1791 showed a marked change in Tipu&amp;rsquo;s approach to temples and Brahmins when faced with an all round attack. &amp;ldquo;Due to past excesses, Tipu’s vakeels were denied an audience by the Maratha chiefs in the run up to the siege of Srirangapatnam.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;broad-goals&#34;&gt;Broad goals&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RoP is a memetic (ie mental) disease of epidemic proportions. It CANNOT coexist with devadharma in the long run- one WILL have to give way to another. Carriers of this memetic disease, ie muslims, should be urgently quarantined and treated with compassionate firmness. We may look at how other nations are dealing with the problem. As part of such efforts, fertility of the disease-ridden population should be severely contrained. The only language that the infected people understand and appreciate is one of solid firmness (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-mohammad-bin-salman-defends-china-concentration-camps-muslims-1340592&#34;&gt;MBS_19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hanbali school holds that the two primary sources of Islamic law are the Qur&amp;rsquo;an and the prophetic tradition; the Hanbali school is known for its strong emphasis on verifying and utilizing the latter on equal ground with the former, whereas other schools granted the tradition a secondary role.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hanafi : The sources from which the Hanafis derive Islamic law are, in order of importance and preference: the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an&#34;&gt;Qur&amp;rsquo;an&lt;/a&gt;, the authentic narrations of the Muslim prophet &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad&#34;&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith&#34;&gt;hadith&lt;/a&gt;), consensus of the Muslim community (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijma&#34;&gt;ijma&lt;/a&gt;), analogical reasoning (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiyas&#34;&gt;qiyas&lt;/a&gt;), juristic discretion (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istihsan&#34;&gt;istihsan&lt;/a&gt;) and the customs of the local population enacting said law (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urf&#34;&gt;urf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shafi&amp;rsquo;i: In hierarchical order, the usul al-fiqh consist of: the Quran, the Sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, ijmā&amp;rsquo; (&amp;ldquo;consensus&amp;rdquo;), and qiyas (&amp;ldquo;analogy&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maliki:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mālik regarded the practices of Medina (the first three generations) to be a superior proof of the &amp;ldquo;living&amp;rdquo; sunnah than isolated, although sound, hadiths.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Zahiri school of thought recognizes three sources of the Islamic law within the principles of Islamic jurisprudence. The first is the Qur&amp;rsquo;an, considered by Muslims to be the verbatim word of God; the second consists of the prophetic as given in historically verifiable reports, which consist of the sayings and actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad; the last is absolute consensus of the Muslim community.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;prominent-shia-schools&#34;&gt;Prominent shia schools&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jaʿfari school: The time and space bound rulings of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school. It differs from the four schools or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab&#34;&gt;madhhabs&lt;/a&gt; of Sunni &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh&#34;&gt;jurisprudence&lt;/a&gt; in its reliance on &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijtihad&#34;&gt;ijtihad&lt;/a&gt;, as well as on matters of inheritance, religious taxes, commerce, personal status and the allowing of temporary marriage or&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikah_mut%E2%80%98ah&#34;&gt;mutʿa&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;- Zaidiyyah: In matters of Islamic jurisprudence, the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn ’Ali&amp;rsquo;s teachings which are documented in his book Majmu’ al-Fiqh.&#xA;- Abathi&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular hadiths they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason (qiyas) in deciding difficulties.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;indian-muslim-demographics&#34;&gt;Indian muslim demographics&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Indian Muslims are 80-85% Sunni.

I am a visitor to USA and got interested in the topic since I have school going grandchildren studying here. I majored in history and have taught English literature at Delhi University for many years. Coming to your question I have had the opportunity to read three history books recommended for grade 6 and have been quite alarmed at the manner in which some Hindu customs and beliefs are being interpreted and represented.

Consequently, signaling suffering to others can be an effective strategy for attaining resources. Victims may receive attention, sympathy, and social status, as well as financial support and other benefits. And being a victim can generate certain kinds of power: It can justify the seeking of retribution, provide a sense of legitimacy or psychological standing to speak on certain issues, and may even confer moral impunity by minimizing blame for victims’ own wrongdoings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their atrocities in Iraq by described the English observers are no different from those of the current Khilafat or any other Jihad. But the Osman Khilafat saw them as competitors and together with their Egyptian allies crushed the Saud. Then the Saud shifted gears to being quiescent like bacteria expressing the toxins from a toxin-antitoxin system until eventually they had the classic opportunity of a mleccha-marūnmattābhisaṃdhi to ally with the Anglosphere, reestablish their power and regain most of their territory.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/07/09/a-geopolitical-package-july-2016/&#34;&gt;MT16&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One must go on a Jihad, atleast once a year&amp;hellip;..one may use a catapult against them when they are in a fortress, even if among them are women and children.

The third title he has is The Witch-Hunter Psycho King. Christian historians only highlight him for creating the King James Version &amp;amp; have deliberately hidden his monstrous, phobic, maniacal side.+++(5)+++ In his James VI, king of Scotland avatar, he commissioned the witch trials &amp;amp; executions. As the Hindi saying goes,“सौ चूहे खाके बिल्ली चली हज को,&amp;quot; in his James I, king of England avatar, he commissioned the King James Bible translation. The KJV must be named MJV. M= Monster. Christianity preaches: people that take up godly tasks like Bible translations can do it only by the lead of the holy spirit.+++(5)+++ So, James was apparently led by the holy spirit for commissioning the Bible. What spirit was he led by for hunting witches? Evil? Holy &amp;amp; evil at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They hunted in a pack as habitual predators, and started killing off the deer, picking on the young and vulnerable first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The deer appealed to the State for protection. State said wolves are a minority, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; will be protected. But but said the deer, it is we who need protection. We do not interfere with the wolves, we leave them alone, but they don&amp;rsquo;t. But the State was unmoved. All species are equal, and minorities need protection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Abrahamic Worship&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;pUjA&amp;rdquo; (=adoration) distinction. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9-bFtSKie0&amp;amp;index=7&amp;amp;list=PL6DF39CE9DE9554AD&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4b3hfoUUNQ&amp;amp;list=PL6DF39CE9DE9554AD&amp;amp;index=12&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67KEqTYNXr8&amp;amp;index=13&amp;amp;list=PL6DF39CE9DE9554AD&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0seNsxMTs&amp;amp;index=14&amp;amp;list=PL6DF39CE9DE9554AD&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Abrahamic concept of worship is more rigid - God tells you how he should be served in revelations; you cannot go worship him through idols, for example. So there  is the concept of &amp;ldquo;right worship&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;false worship&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;By contrast, pUjA can take many forms. Consider: आकाशात् पतितं तोयं यथा गच्छति सागरम्। सर्वदेवनमस्काराः केशवं प्रति गच्छति॥&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The famous Abrahamist objection to  goes: &amp;ldquo;Worship the creator, not the creation.&amp;rdquo; Implying that one is forced to have a dichotomy between the creator and his creation in matters of worship.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The target of pUjA need not be Gods or deities. Does Ayudha-pUja necessarily imply in the mind of the worshipper that a Maruti Car is a God? Is such a belief even required? Even if one considers the car to be one of the places where the divine resides, this still contrasts with the notion of Abrahamic worship which would prohibit such &amp;ldquo;idolatory&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Belief in a certain dogma is important in worship, but not in pUjA. Christian belief is that worship of false Gods takes you to hell.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pUjA is more flexible: doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any fixed belief - it may only require the concept of sahRdayatA while performing the pUjA; the fact that it has to do with emotional well being rather than physical well being; that the beliefs in the bhAvanA-loka (emotional world) are separate from beliefs about the physical world.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Quotes from Abrahamists upon uncountering heathen art: &lt;a href=&#34;https://storify.com/blog_supplement/encounters-of-barbarous-mlechchas-with-heathen-shr?utm_campaign=website&amp;amp;utm_source=email&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;grudging-proto-polytheism&#34;&gt;Grudging proto-polytheism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One observes in monotheisms a grudging continuation of polytheisms. Examples: &lt;a href=&#34;images/snippets/polytheism_in_monotheism_jewish.jpg&#34;&gt;jewish prayer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;images/snippets/polytheism_in_monotheism_christian.jpg&#34;&gt;catholic prayer&lt;/a&gt;, greek orthodox anathema ritual (where those who see polytheism in worship of icons and such are declared &amp;ldquo;anathema&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In Islam, there are a variety of angels (belief in them is one of the 6 articles of faith), with distinct traits and physical features. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aaolomi/status/1154103012274520064&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;rules in the modern state of Saudi Arabia, in particular, the rules governing the measure of wrongful death damages.45 According to the Indian Consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the families of Indian expatriates working in the Kingdom can claim wrongful death compensation pursuant to a schedule of fixed amounts. However, the amounts vary depending on the victim&amp;rsquo;s religious convictions and gender. If the victim is a Muslim male, his family can claim SR100,000. But if the victim is a Christian or Jewish male, the family can only claim half that amount, namely SR50,000. Further, if the victim belongs to another faith group, such as Hindu, Sikh, or Jain, his family can claim only approximately SR6,667. The family of a female victim can claim half the amount allowed for her male co-religionist. 46 Arguably, it seems that Saudi Arabia patterns its wrongful death compensatory regime on early Hanbali rules of tort liability. For example, premodern Muslim jurists held that the diyya or wrongful death compensation for a free Muslim male was one hundred camels.47 But if the victim is a Jew or Christian male, his family could only claim a percentage of that amount. The Shafi&amp;rsquo;is held that the family was entitled to one-third of what a free Muslim male&amp;rsquo;s family would receive.48 But the Malikis and Hanbalis granted them one-half of what a Muslim&amp;rsquo;s family could obtain.49 Furthermore, Sunni and Shi&amp;rsquo;a jurists held that if the victim was a Magian (majus), his family received even less, namely 1/15th of what a free Muslim male was worth.50 Importantly, 1/15th of SR100,000 is approximately SR6667, the amount a Hindu, Sikh, or Jain&amp;rsquo;s family can claim under current Saudi law.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems the relationship between दुष्ट-सोरः &amp;amp; the chIna-s has soured. The emperor&amp;rsquo;s edict describing him as what he really is was released. Irrespective of where 1 stands vis-a-vis the chIna-s, they are spot on regarding this &amp;amp; as they have been regarding some other issues. He has clearly struck back &amp;amp; we have to see how the chIna-s handle his assault.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is case where enemy&amp;rsquo;s enemy is not friend &amp;ndash; he is as much or more the enemy of H too. It is also important for multiple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The text showed how the original doctrine of the Brahmins was monotheism &amp;amp; anti-idolatry! This Ezourvedam was given to Voltaire and for the better part of 50 years, it lent the impression to European intellectuals that the religion of the Indians had also opposed idolatrous superstitions at the start. Issac Newton himself thought the Brahmins of India are direct descendants of Abraham and even the word Brahmana comes from Abrahamans (sons of Abraham) and that Abraham instructed the Brahmins in worship of one god without images &amp;amp; sent them to the east. This influenced Voltaire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From : Yusuf Unjhawala&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;origin&#34;&gt;Origin&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dawoodi Bohra belief system comes from the Fatimids of Egypt. Fatimids were Ismaili Shias who ruled Egypt and North Africa for about 300 years (900-1200AD). There were splits prior to the Fatimids and during the Fatimids. One branch of the Fatimids are the Nizaris (today&amp;rsquo;s Aga Khanis), other is Mustali which are Bohras.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the reign of Mustansir (circa 1000 AD - an Imam for the Bohras) missionaries were sent to Gujarat. They managed to convert a few. Thats how it started. The early converts were not known as Bohras. That wouldve happened later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They pointed out stereotypes and errors in the textbooks. They were concerned that controversial and racist statements could create xenophobia in the minds of American students and also negatively impact the identity formation of Jewish, Hindu, and Muslim-American children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

According to the SBE Standards, education should “instill in each child a sense of pride in his or her heritage [and] develop a feeling of self-worth” and “enable all students to become aware and accepting of religious diversity”. Importantly, Social Studies education should “eradicate the roots of prejudice”. Remarkably, and contrary to the stated standards, there is a documented predominance of negativity applied to Hinduism, a subtle but ubiquitous critical slant that is absent in the presentation of other religious traditions written for adolescent California school children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This in itself should cause alarm. You would not invite known anti-Semites to oversee the edits about Judaism. Though Daniel Pipes is a good scholar and on the board of the U.S. Institute for peace, the Muslim families in California would not want Daniel Pipes&amp;ndash; a known critic of Islam&amp;ndash;to determine the narrative about their religious traditions written for California’s Muslim children and their classmates. The same applies regarding Michael Witzel’s selectively radical interpretation of Hinduism negatively juxtaposed against the evolving self–image of sensitive adolescent Hindu children in California.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
