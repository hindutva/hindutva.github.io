It's hilarious to still come across videos from self-styled apologists in India repeating the outdated, now debunked lie which goes like this:

> "Dionysius Exiguus, the 6th century monk dated the birth of Jesus to Dec 25th based on the year of the founding of the Roman empire."

The date for the founding of the Roman empire itself is shrouded in mystery. Imagine how accurate the dating for Jesus is. Modern #ChristianMythologists fraudulently promoted that every historical event is dated based on the birth of Jesus. This is the greatest lie ever told. 

The Christian calendar (A.D/B.C.) was not invented until the 6th century. Does that mean historical events in that part of the world were not dated until the 6th century? Of course, they were. Events weren't waiting for the #JesusBirthMyth to be created for being given a date. 

- The first Christians for whom Jesus was only a mythical, celestial being and not an earthly being, used the Jewish calendar for their festivals and dating their events. 
- Early #ChristianMythologists employed the Roman system of dating events according to the reigns of emperors.
- Later some Christians quit the Roman system & began to date their calendars from the "Age of Martyrs" a particularly bloody period of persecution under Emperor Diocletian (284-305 C.E.).

Interestingly, the Bible doesn't specify a date for the birth of its central hero. The #BiblicalSmoke about Jesus mentions Herod the Great & portrays him as the villain of the Jesus birth fiction. The #BibleMytholgy refers to him as the monster who killed all the babies under 2 yrs old in Bethlehem. We know from real history that Herod died in 4 B.C.E. That means at the time of Herod’s baby killing spree, Jesus had to be under 2. Means he would've had to be born anywhere between 7 B.C.E. to 4 B.C.E. So, how did the date 1 A.D. come about? Well, the only answer is whoever did the calculation is a fraudster or a dunce.

The Christian calendar is based on a miscalculation. This truth is an accepted view among many mainstream Christian scholars. They placed the birth of their hero sometime between 7 B.C.E. & 2 B.C.E. John Barton, professor of Bible interpretation at Oxford, is one such scholar. He said 

> "most academics agreed that the Christian calendar was wrong & that J would've had to be born several yrs earlier than commonly thought. There's no reference to when he was born in the Bible. All we know is that he was born in the reign of Herod, who died before 1A.D....The idea of celebrating his birth during the darkest part of the year is probably linked to pagan traditions and the winter solstice."

The most shocking revelation comes from the very org that invented the myth in the 1st place & the calendar in the 2nd –the Roman Church. Pope Benedict, leader of the world’s 1 bn Roman Catholics admitted to the fact that the Christian calendar is based on a miscalculation. The Pope added other controversaries that contrary to the traditional belief, there were no oxen, donkeys or other animals at J’s birth. What the pope forgot to add is the missing mention of the virgin birth in the #JesusBirthMyth. Probably, he left the task of admitting to that fraud to future popes.+++(5)+++ After all, Poppa knows that his flock can't take the facts about their dark history all at once. It took this many centuries for all the other skeletons that we know today, to tumble out of Christianity's closet. The #VirginBirthMyth too will, soon. It's just a matter of time! Satan, my alter ego, the Most Truthful One, will not rest until the truth is all out!

Question is, 'who made this grand mistake that slaps Christianity hard in its face & makes its followers look like dunces for celebrating a make-believe birthday of their savior hero?' It was the 6th century monk known as Dionysius Exiguus, also called Dennis the Little.

"The calculation of the beginning of our calendar — based on the birth of Jesus — was made by Dionysius Exiguus, who made a mistake in his calculations by several years.” - Pope Benedict, The Infant Narratives.
