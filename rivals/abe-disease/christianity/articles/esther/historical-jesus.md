What every Hindu must say to a Christian that comes to "share the gospel:" "first get a clarity on whether Jesus even existed & if he did, what exaclty he taught & then come to preach."

Here is a brief insight into how shaky the grounds are on which Christianity stands today.
Thomas Jefferson: primary author of the Declaration of Independence called the original sin, virgin birth &resurrection as superstitions & fabrications; calls NT writers ignorant, unlettered men; creates his own bible, strips J of divinity; reduces him to just another philosopher
Who said America was founded on Christian values?? & Jefferson was not alone. Many thologians have rewritten accounts of Jesus' life to compensate for deficiencies in the NT.

1906 - Albert Schweitzer, wrote Quest of the Historical Jesus; eliminates resurrection from the story.

FF to our times: Geza Vermes, world's leading authority on Jesus &Christianity, popularized the search for historical Jesus. Soon followed Stephen Mitchell’s The Gospel Acc. to Jesus, John Spong’s Tales of a Jewish Mystic, Reza Aslan’s Zealot:The Life & Times of Jesus of Nazareth

1970s - NT scholar Robert Funk began the Jesus Seminar to examine who Jesus was & what he said. The scholar members of the Seminar denied the view that the Bible was divinely inspired. It relegated 80% of the sayings attributed to Jesus to myth, fable, fiction, legend & hearsay.
