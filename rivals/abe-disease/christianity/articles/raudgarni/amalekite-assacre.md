> "Remember what Amalek did to you on the way as you were coming out of Egypt,  how he met you on the way and attacked your rear ranks, all the stragglers at your rear, when you were tired and weary; and he did not fear God."

You forgot the 400 year time gap. Saul's massacre of the Amalekites was 400 years after the events described. David also has a later massacre of the Amalekites.

The Christian moral justifications are flimsy, the old testament belongs to a completely different tribal morality.

> St. John Chrysostom called their religion the synkatabasis (condescension) of God.

I know the Christian arguments, and they strike me as an excuse for proto liberalism, meddling with what the gods established because some people wanted social reforms or more political control. Once you admit that, Christianity can be yet another condescension or ploy.

> In the "debate" (more like a massacre) between Alex O'Connor u see that moron Dinesh D'Souza completely abandon the field on this & many other points saying that rabbis or Dennis Prager will answer Alex not him as he could offer no defense of Yahweh/Jesus

## Morality vs tribalism
There's an obvious defense it just removes their worship of morality and puts the worship of the god in its place.

The real problem with the Canaanites isn't that they killed children or whatever else the Torah briefly accuses. It's that they didn't do it for Yahweh.

David, Moses, Joshua, Abraham even, would all be called wicked and immoral if they weren't Jews. It's not what you do so much as who, why, what context. That's how the biblical morality is and stripped of pretense it has no real difference from pagan moralities.

After that point is admitted Christians have nothing but the sheer truth claims of their religion to fall back on. It doesn't matter that David was bandit, he was God's bandit. Similar to what Gregory of Tours said of Clovis.

Or they have to fall back on consequentialism.
