title = "Damned infants"

> Augustine believed that all unbaptised infants were damned. 

St. Gregory, the pope, also spelled out this doctrine. And it was official doctrine for most of history. Capeshit is a good term for it. I don't think most Christians believe the religious stuff is real. If I literally believed my God puts infants in hell I wouldn't be ...worried about some ancient cultures practicing infanticide or modern day abortions. The god is a million times worse than any human could be. But most don't believe in this doctrine even where it is on the books or logically applies.


I don't have a religion that has arbitrary damnation based on belief. I have no reason to despair over such issues. 

You can accuse the gods of being cruel or unfair but they've never done anything like that. Even Christians don't accuse them of putting infants in hell.
