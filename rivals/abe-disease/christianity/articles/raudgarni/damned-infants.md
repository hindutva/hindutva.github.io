title = "Damned infants"

> Augustine believed that all unbaptised infants were damned. 

St. Gregory, the pope, also spelled out this doctrine. And it was official doctrine for most of history. Capeshit is a good term for it. I don't think most Christians believe the religious stuff is real. If I literally believed my God puts infants in hell I wouldn't be ...worried about some ancient cultures practicing infanticide or modern day abortions. The god is a million times worse than any human could be. But most don't believe in this doctrine even where it is on the books or logically applies.


I don't have a religion that has arbitrary damnation based on belief. I have no reason to despair over such issues. 

You can accuse the gods of being cruel or unfair but they've never done anything like that. Even Christians don't accuse them of putting infants in hell.

## yahweh vs babies

The context doesn't matter. The point is Yahweh doesn't give a shit about babies or human life as an abstract thing free of context. He kills the children of those Israelites who dont obey him too. Children are extensions of parents in biblical thought, not valuable alone.

Human life doesnt have inherent worth, only obedience protects you. If you arent on Yahwehs good list he doesnt value your life or anyone around you. And this can be quite arbitrary. 

Yahweh has a man's whole family killed along with him merely for keeping loot rather than offering it as sacrifice to Yahweh. 

He kills David's infant son for David's adultery. 

He threatens to make parents eat their children if they anger him.
