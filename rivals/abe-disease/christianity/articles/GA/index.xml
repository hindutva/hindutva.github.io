      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/GhorAngirasa/status/1974378024754712662&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A subtle point to note is how Xtians like to use the idea of “concessions” when they encounter something unsavoury or unpalatable in their scriptures. A few examples follow:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ritual-sacrifice-shift&#34;&gt;Ritual sacrifice shift&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yahuda sacrificial system in Vayikra (Leviticus) under the “old covenant” obviously resembled that found in Near-Eastern polytheisms. Xtian theologians often point out that these rituals were a concession &amp;amp; were done away with under the new covenant under Jesus, who performs the final and ultimate sacrifice with himself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t make much sense. If one is making a concession and is merely tolerating a certain state of affairs, why would he express a particular preference for certain aromas? Why dedicate so many rules to what he wants from each type of sacrifice. Concessions suggest a minimalistic approach, which does not square with the level of detail accorded to the sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
