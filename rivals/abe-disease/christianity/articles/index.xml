      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: A 2015-08-31 article on the net.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An appraisal about mormonism from the hindu standpoint: benefits, cohesion, barriers&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following is from a dialog amonga few friends about the LSD (sorry LDS) church.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;priesthood-levels&#34;&gt;Priesthood levels&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my mid-twenties, I had been baptised in the LDS Church. I was actively involved with various other religious groups at the time, and this I told my Mormon teachers who had been giving me lessons for a few months, but they honestly said, ‚ÄúBaptism is only the beginning, not the end. It only qualifies you to continue to study our theory and sacraments.‚Äù So I did. After baptism, one is automatically inducted into the first level ‚ÄúAaronic priesthood‚Äù. Based on proven abilities and completed sacraments, one can rise up to higher priesthoods such as Melchizedek, etc. In many ways, the LDS Church is modeled on Freemasonry or other esoteric schools with their distinction betwen neophytes,&#xA;hierophants, adepts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shinzo Abe‚Äôs Assassin and Japan‚Äôs Complicated Spirituality&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The country‚Äôs so-called new religions have caused a disproportionate amount of turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By Hiroko Yoda&lt;br&gt;&#xA;July 26, 2022&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Portrait of Shinzo Abe seen during ceremony at the Japan Embassy in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Japan is not widely known for religious extremism or gun violence, and yet Abe‚Äôs association with the Unification Church was his murderer‚Äôs apparent motive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The killing of the former Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, on July 8th, sent shock waves rippling across Japan and the globe. Even after stepping down as Prime Minister, in the summer of 2020, owing to health issues, Abe was that rarest of presences on the Japanese political scene: an internationally recognizable face, even a celebrity. His hawkish brand of conservatism divided Japan and infuriated many leaders in the region, but endeared him to others, most famously Donald Trump. And, as the single longest-serving prime minister in Japan‚Äôs history, he remained, in many ways, the country‚Äôs face to the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

E.g. as Europeans they presented themselves as Indian monks following a special strand of Buddhism. A short üßµ.

March 25 (the Roman vernal equinox) became popular for his crucifixion, Dec 25 (the winter solstice) for his birth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;equinox-for-crucifixion-day&#34;&gt;Equinox for crucifixion day&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early 3rd c. evidence demonstrates that these chronographers started to settle on March 25 as the crucifixion day.

Usually disease or some other family problem are mentioned. Not even SC callers have mentioned jati discrimination as the reason+++(5)+++.

That is the &amp;ldquo;secular&amp;rdquo; interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;jewish-killing&#34;&gt;Jewish killing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They (Christians) believe the Biblical narrative in which Jesus was God and was &amp;ldquo;killed&amp;rdquo; neither by the Jews and Romans. In the Biblical narrative, the Jewish pharisees and high priest demand that Jesus be crucified even though Pilate saw no fault in Jesus. Even when given the option to pardon a criminal, the Jews favored the murder/bandit Barabbas over Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nazis smeared excrement on church altars and church doors, desecrated shrines, and threw statues of saints into dung piles; and when synagogues were not available to  attack and loot, churches were often the target with Nazis yelling:  &amp;lsquo;Down with Christians and Jews!&amp;rdquo; -  The Nazi War on Christianity by Bruce Walker, p. 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What Bolshevism is achieving today on the materialist and technical level, Christianity had achieved on the metaphysical level. When the Crown sees the throne totter, it needs the support of the masses. It would be better to speak of Constantine the Traitor and Julian the Loyal than of Constantine the Great and Julian the Apostate.+++(5)+++ What the Christians wrote against the Emperor Julian is approximately of the same calibre as what the Jews have written against us.+++(4 Conceit!)+++ The writings of the Emperor Julian, on the other hand, are products of the highest wisdom.+++(5)+++ If humanity took the trouble to study and understand history, the resulting consequences would have incalculable implications.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lafcadio Hearn reports on June 1, 1893 about Christians targeting Japanese kids for conversion by giving them money &amp;amp; trying to buy land (many Japanese even those in poverty refused to sell) to set up missions&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Postwar Japan: Japanese who did convert to Christianity were derisively called &amp;ldquo;rice Christians&amp;rdquo; by other Japanese. The derogatory nickname implied that missionaries provided material or financial benefit as inducement to converts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan - people at that time called Catholciism &amp;ldquo;powdered milkism&amp;rdquo; (naifenjiao) or &amp;ldquo;flourism&amp;rdquo; (mianfenjiao).77 And the Church was known as the &amp;ldquo;flour church.&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; Although most of Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s population rejoiced in its newfound prosperity&amp;hellip; not everyone on the island found these processes comforting. Protestant missionaries&amp;hellip; discovered that economic progress was hindering Christian expansion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Burning alive the missionary&amp;rsquo;s two sons (aged 10 and 6) does not help the H cause, imho. (Some claim that DS was not guilty, but the ppl supporting him on the web assume that he was and celebrate him for it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are the exact events detailed somewhere? I imagine Graham would&amp;rsquo;ve been warned to get out (and face death) or his vehicle would be burned with kids. Did he reject possibility of kids being spared and keep them inside?

The &amp;lsquo;Replies&amp;rsquo; of Mr. Bryan served but little to enlighten the ever-growing question; and now comes Baba Bharati of this city, who is an article in the current issue of the &amp;lsquo;Light of India,&amp;rsquo; not only corroborates the sentiments expressed by the first writer, but adds thereto.

The text showed how the original doctrine of the Brahmins was monotheism &amp;amp; anti-idolatry! This Ezourvedam was given to Voltaire and for the better part of 50 years, it lent the impression to European intellectuals that the religion of the Indians had also opposed idolatrous superstitions at the start. Issac Newton himself thought the Brahmins of India are direct descendants of Abraham and even the word Brahmana comes from Abrahamans (sons of Abraham) and that Abraham instructed the Brahmins in worship of one god without images &amp;amp; sent them to the east. This influenced Voltaire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
