The Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, et al. could not even tolerate Mormons and Anabaptists who worship Jesus Christ. Why would they tolerate pagans? Countless people were burnt at the stake for "blaspheming Christ" or "blaspheming the Holy Spirit." 

Calvin and the Geneva Consistory had the Spanish physician Servetus burnt at the stake (indirectly via magistrate) because he likened the Trinity to three-headed Cerberus (one of the "Hounds of Hades").

Freedom of speech implies freedom to criticize religion and this includes criticism of even the most intolerant religions like Christianity and Islam.
