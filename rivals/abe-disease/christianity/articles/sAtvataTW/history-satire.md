- The existence of archangel Gabriel is historically accurate
- Parthenogenesis in humans is historically accurate.
- Jesus being born before 4 BC ("in the days of king Herod") and after 6 AD (during the first census when Quirinius was governor of Syria) is historically accurate, despite these dates being mutually exclusive by approximately a decade.
- A universal census requiring people to travel to ancestral towns, an event unattested in Roman administrative records, is historically accurate.
- Joseph and Mary leaving Nazareth and arriving at a city which just so happens to have the same name as the Messianic tribe mentioned in Micah 5:2 is historically accurate and in no way suggests retroactive Messianic prophecy fulfillment.
- Babylonian wise men divining the birth of a Jewish messiah via astrology (a practice condemned elsewhere in the Bible, BTW) and traveling to an obscure Judean backwater in alleged fulfillment of the Seventy Weeks prophecy of Daniel is historically accurate.
- Herod ordering the slaughter of all infants in Judea is historically accurate, notwithstanding the absence of any extrabiblical attestation from any contemporary historians who meticulously recorded Herod's far smaller atrocities.

None of this is legendary. None of this is messianic or theological propaganda. This is all history. 

If you say otherwise, you are an anti-Christian bigot.
