## Similarity
Many Christians regard Hinduism and Buddhism as demonic.

At the core of Christianity is a belief in substitutionary atonement through the consumption of the flesh and blood of a risen savior deity. This risen savior deity is the "Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."

In my opinion, the closest cult to Christianity are the Orphic–Dionysian mysteries. 

As per Orphic theology, Dionysus Zagreus, the son of Zeus and Persephone, was torn apart and eaten by the Titans. Zeus destroys the Titans with his thunderbolt and humanity is born their ashes, hence humans contain both Titanic ("sinful") and Dionysian ("divine") elements.

The Orphic rites involved ritual meals of bread and wine representing the body and blood of Dionysus, symbolic participation in the god’s suffering and rebirth, and mystical union with the deity through "eating and drinking Dionysus."

It is quite possible that sacramental praxis of a blood-magic cult akin to the Orphic-Dionysian cults was foisted upon the cult of an apocalyptic Jewish zealot who was seen as a criminal by the Romans to give rise to Christianity.

## Differences
However, this is ultimately speculative and there are noticeable differences as well.

### Salvation
For example, the Orphics believed in an eternal cosmic cycle involving metempsychosis and believed in salvation through both purification AND gnosis/knowledge.

On the other hand, early Christianity placed emphasis on salvation through faith. There was also a stronger eschatological urgency, as the early Christians viewed crucifixion as a once-for-all act of self-sacrifice in accordance with Judaism's linear timeline, not as an act that repeats itself every cosmic cycle like the dismemberment of Dionysus.

### Apocalypse
The early Christians believed in an eminent apocalpyse. In their view, Christ would return triumphant within their lifetime with his army of angels and cast all non-believers in eternal hellfire:

> "And He was saying to them, 'Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God having come with power.'"
Mark 9:1  
"For truly I say to you, you shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes."  
Matthew 10:23  
"We declare to you that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who have fallen asleep."
1 Thessalonians 4:15  
"Repose with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with His mighty angels, blazing fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus."  
2 Thessalonians 1:7   

#### Delay
The absence of an imminent apocalpyse led to the crisis often referred to as the "Delay of the Parousia."

As a result of this failed expectation, there was an increased emphasis on statements such as "concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only."

## Hypothetical value
In my opinion, this is an area of study which is much more promising than bizarre claims of Christianity emerging from Mahayana Buddhism. Unfortunately, there is scarcity in the surviving Orphic fragments, so there are limits as to what we can reliably reconstruct.

Much of what can be said has already been said by previous scholars; however, based on the Orphic Hymns, fragments from Euripides' Bacchae, etc., it is almost certainly the closest pre-Christian parallel to Christianity.
