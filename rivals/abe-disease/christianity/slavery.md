## Paul
> “Slaves, obey your human masters with fear and trembling; and do it with a sincere heart, as though you were serving Christ. Do this not only when they are watching you, because you want to gain their approval; but with all your heart do what God wants, as slaves of Christ. Do your work as slaves cheerfully, as though you served the Lord, and not merely human beings.”—Ephesians 6:5-7

### Philemon
Yet, he writes to Philemon to forgive and accept  escaped former slave Onesimus : [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW9Q3Jt6Yvk)

> If it was just adapting to the social context of the day and asking slaves to not revolt or merely asking Philemon to “forgive” a runaway slave, why is there a doubly intimidating emphasis on fear (φόβου/phobou) & trembling (τρόμου/tromou) & asking slaves to see their slavery as a service to “the Lord” and not to men: μετ’ εὐνοίας δουλεύοντες, ὡς τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ οὐκ ἀνθρώποις. You are coping & you know it. -GA
