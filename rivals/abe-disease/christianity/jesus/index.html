  <meta property="og:description" content="Personality Below, we talk about the Nicene Jesus. (Gnostic Christ seems have been *much* better. There were other “Christ&#34;s too - some say all of them were fictional.) Jesus, if he existed, was racist. (As more non-jew converts came in, this was subsumed by a broader out-group hostility.) (Matthew 15:21-28 and Mark 7:24-30) - “Gentile (non-Jew) woman once begged him to cast away the demon that had possessed her daughter… He cold-heartedly told the woman that only the Jews were his children and that the Gentiles were dogs. He wouldn’t heal a dog. Only then Jesus relented.”(Kalavai-201501, verse in KJ bible and translation) Jesus was misogynist. (Kalavai-201501) Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet. (Kalavai-201501) Early christians prophesied that he will cause a bloody genocide to happen. “According to The Bible, Jesus would return to the earth holding a sickle in his hand (Revelation 14:14). An angel would tell him that it is time to start a bloody genocide. Another sickle-wielding angel would join Jesus and the duo would start a violent carnage. The blood they spill would cover the ground up to the horses’ bridles in a space of 1,600 furlongs (Revelation 14:15-20). … According to this contradictory biblical prophecy, Jesus would unleash the might of the sword and hunger to annihilate a fourth of the population (Revelation 6:8). … Jesus would then let loose four angels, who would massacre one-third of the remaining population (i.e., 1.75 billion). Jesus won’t take the chill pill yet. He would instead command 200 million fire-breathing horsemen to massacre a third of the survivors. &#34; (Kalavai-jesus-genocide) Jesus was not a Yogi because he said “Kingdom of God is within you.” &#34; As Bart Ehrman has shown (Jesus Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible, pp. 77-78), not only is the Sermon on the Mount a very late interpolation into the Bible but its message is not one of inward perfection as in the Yoga. Its message is apocalyptic; Jesus expected the end of the world to happen very soon. The verse actually means that the coming Kingdom of God is there and present among the Jewish Christians that were his contemporary followers. In this racist teaching, Gentiles are excluded from that kingdom. “(Kalavai-201501) “The result was a dishonest book, The Kingdom of God is Within You, in which Tolstoy gave the apocalyptic Jesus a complete botox-like makeover and transformed him into a contemplative teacher who sought perfection within as a Hindu yogi does. Many unthinking Hindus, starting with Mahatma Gandhi, have popularized this propagandist story without realizing that it serves to disarm and proselytize unsuspecting Hindus.” (Kalavai-201501) Jesus did not abrogate the troublesome 10 commandments (such as the one against image worship).

<ul>
<li>Below, we talk about the Nicene Jesus. (Gnostic Christ seems have been *much* better. There were other &ldquo;Christ&quot;s too - some say all of them were fictional.)</li>
<li>Jesus, if he existed, was racist. (As more non-jew converts came in, this was subsumed by a broader out-group hostility.)
<ul>
<li>(Matthew 15:21-28 and Mark 7:24-30) - &ldquo;Gentile (non-Jew) woman once begged him to cast away the demon that had possessed her daughter&hellip; He cold-heartedly told the woman that only the Jews were his children and that the Gentiles were dogs. He wouldn’t heal a dog. Only then Jesus relented.&rdquo;(<a href="http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY">Kalavai-201501</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%E0%AE%AE%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%AF%E0%AF%81+15%3A21-28&amp;version=KJV">verse in KJ bible and translation</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jesus was misogynist. (<a href="http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY">Kalavai-201501</a>)</li>
<li>Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet. (<a href="http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY">Kalavai-201501</a>)
<ul>
<li>Early christians prophesied that he will cause a bloody genocide to happen.
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;According to The Bible, Jesus would return to the earth holding a sickle in his hand (Revelation 14:14). An angel would tell him that it is time to start a bloody genocide. Another sickle-wielding angel would join Jesus and the duo would start a violent carnage. The blood they spill would cover the ground up to the horses’ bridles in a space of 1,600 furlongs (Revelation 14:15-20). &hellip; According to this contradictory biblical prophecy, Jesus would unleash the might of the sword and hunger to annihilate a fourth of the population (Revelation 6:8).  &hellip; Jesus would then let loose four angels, who would massacre one-third of the remaining population (i.e., 1.75 billion). Jesus won’t take the chill pill yet. He would instead command 200 million fire-breathing horsemen to massacre a third of the survivors. &quot; (<a href="http://indiafacts.co.in/jesus-christ-impending-genocide/#.VLE2gDlGjUZ">Kalavai-jesus-genocide</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jesus was not a Yogi because he said &ldquo;Kingdom of God is within you.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>&quot; As Bart Ehrman has shown (Jesus Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible, pp. 77-78), not only is the Sermon on the Mount a very late interpolation into the Bible but its message is not one of inward perfection as in the Yoga. Its message is apocalyptic; Jesus expected the end of the world to happen very soon. The verse actually means that the coming Kingdom of God is there and present among the Jewish Christians that were his contemporary followers. In this racist teaching, Gentiles are excluded from that kingdom. &ldquo;(<a href="http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY">Kalavai-201501</a>)</li>
<li>&ldquo;The result was a dishonest book, The Kingdom of God is Within You, in which Tolstoy gave the apocalyptic Jesus a complete botox-like makeover and transformed him into a contemplative teacher who sought perfection within as a Hindu yogi does. Many unthinking Hindus, starting with Mahatma Gandhi, have popularized this propagandist story without realizing that it serves to disarm and proselytize unsuspecting  Hindus.&rdquo; (<a href="http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY">Kalavai-201501</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jesus did not abrogate the troublesome 10 commandments (such as the one against image worship). [Catholic view: <a href="http://www.catholic.com/quickquestions/did-jesus-alter-the-commandment-about-observing-the-sabbath">2015-here</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/e96q67P.png">image</a>]</li>
