The worship of the lord like the posted above has been prohibited by the Holy See! This son is actually going against many decrees, doctrines and directives still are in force. I am making a small list with all the references given.

This kind of worship is against the Code of Canon Law (1917)

- Canon 1258: Prohibited Catholics from participating in non-Catholic religious ceremonies.
- Canon 1399: Forbade the reading of books promoting superstition, divination, magic, and other practices contrary to Catholic doctrine.

Pope Pius XI. (1937) in Mit Brennender Sorge detailed Encyclical condemning neopagan ideologies and ordered Christians never to adopt any pagan festivals, ideologies in fact he said "Nothing can be useful..." Putting Lord in the middle of pagan festival is highest sacrilege and those who do this will not be allowed at St Peter's gate.


Catholic teaching, such as the Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy (2001) and the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1992), includes cautions to ensure the integrity of Catholic beliefs and practices. What this son who is lost, has done is against the catechism.

Catechism of the Catholic Church (1992)

Paragraphs 2110â€“2117 explicitly condemn divination, magic, and other practices involving occult powers. 

Since Pongal is about occult power of Uttarayana any reference to traditional Hindu occult beliefs is a grave sin and Jesus would weep.

Now explosive last point. Do you know the Church specifically called out these things done by Indian Jesuits priests and in 1998, notified these kind of worship as non-Christian. Let me share the document. So much so the congregation declared this harmful to the Catholic faith itself and can cause grave harm. Read it. Share it.
