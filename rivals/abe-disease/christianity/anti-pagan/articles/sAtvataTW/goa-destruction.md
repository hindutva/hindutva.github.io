Christians ask people to curse Vishnu, curse Kali, etc. all the time on this site. Do you live under a rock?

The Franciscans destroyed 300 Hindu temples in Bardez in a single year (as per Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino).

The Jesuits set ablaze the entire village of Assolná along with all its twenty temples (pagodes) before marching onto Cuncolim, burning it down as well, slaughtering a cow, and profaning the tank of the Śāntādurgā temple by sprinkling it with blood from the viscera of a cow.

The Dominicans established the ecclesiastical tribunal (i.e. inquisition) at Goa and forcibly abducted non-Christian "orphans" (anyone whose father died was deemed an orphan by the Portuguese) at Diu from the arms of their relatives and raised them as baptized Christian believers.
