> "Deeds of the Abbots of St. Albans" by the pretAcharin Matthew Paris recounts a curious incident. In ~1000 CE in the ruins of the formerly Roman town of Verulamium (made St. Albans by the pretaka-s) Roman-age books in in a British language were found containing "invocations & rites of idolaters". They were said to describe the worship of the "Phebum deum solis" (god of the sun Phebus)& "Mercurium, Woden Anglice appellatum", Mercury, called Woden in English. The books were promptly "rejected& burnt by the abbots as "fabrications of the devil". - MT
