It seems the relationship between दुष्ट-सोरः & the chIna-s has soured. The emperor's edict describing him as what he really is was released. Irrespective of where 1 stands vis-a-vis the chIna-s, they are spot on regarding this & as they have been regarding some other issues. He has clearly struck back & we have to see how the chIna-s handle his assault. 

This is case where enemy's enemy is not friend -- he is as much or more the enemy of H too. It is also important for multiple reasons: 

1. This shows that he has assets to potentially strike even behind well-fortified walls of Peking. 
2. It gives a taste of the various tactics he can deploy, including against H. Everyone knows how he caused the prAchya-paNa-saMbhrama. So far he has focused on the toolkit but he could expand operations as his urgency to overthrow the lATapati rises
3. It allows the relatively less-informed to parse events in the desh. It is amply visible that his agents have been causing droha even as his assets have deeply penetrated institutions. If shashayAbhaka could be his asset, then what to say of all the little panjandrums+++(=massive, rocket-propelled, explosive-laden carts)+++ he has purchased. 
4. If one tests beautiful beggar search engine one finds hints that the big-tech duShTa-guggulu is likely on his side. 
5. We have photographic evidence that he is close to the kingmaker cabal who put piNDaka on the Asandi & arranged to overthrow of the nAri~NgapuruSha. We heard how the mlechCha-dUtya was planning to support the marUnmatta-navyonmatta alliance in bhArata -- probably backed by दुष्ट-सोस्य agents.
