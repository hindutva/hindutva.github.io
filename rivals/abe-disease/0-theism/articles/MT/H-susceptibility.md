In the past parents used to fear the children falling prey to alcohol and other substances or sexual excesses when they went to college but today they have to fear disease of सामाजिकन्यायवाद much more. It destroy not just their children but their whole lineages. But few are aware.

The storming of the citadels of science, tech& medicine in the occident by navyonmAda is no surprise to its careful observers. The proclivity towards that disease of the mind was already quite deep even by the 1990s and earlier --sooner or later the pathogen was to totally take over the host. Similarly, it seems the H have a high degree of natural susceptibility to navyonmAda unlike some of the prAchya peoples. Thus, it ripping through an already immuno-compromised H population is not entirely a matter of surprise. Saw snippets of a video of malla on a H woman's daughters falling to the disease. Nothing unexpected.

Not saying it is a foolproof strategy but we have always insisted that H should aggressively teach their kids self-non-self discrimination -- not just positive things-

- Who the other are; 
- what are their ideologies & their dangers& the need to uphold ones own pakSha unrelentingly. 
- Political awareness including its geopolitical dimension should be imparted early with no sympathy for the shatru-s

## Converted son

Heard  v1 deshI parents distraught that their son had embraced the navyonmAda and now as member of the krau~nchadvIpIya kAlAmukha-s broke up with the former as being in the al-Jahiliyya. As we remarked in the past it was psychedelics they feared but now it is the disease.

> deshI parenting is lacking in such matters. Perhaps they weren’t sufficiently aware being busy acquiring wealth.

That factor is definitely there but talking to deshI parents on the ground there are more factors. Like the case mentioned above -- I had even attended his upanayanam. But the infection caught once he was college and the parenting signal eroded. Of course the problem was that the parents didnt embedded the right software deep enough. What they did only added a superficial patina that eroded quickly. Another parent who has been v.diligent with his kid confessed that he is fearing college for at some point the peers take over as the dominant meme conductors
