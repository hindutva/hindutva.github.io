The pichChilonmAda+++(=trumpomania)+++ of the American intellectual Sam Harris is not entirely unusual -- it just that he honestly expresses his thoughts in words unlike many others, whose behaviors suggest that they hold ideas very close to him. This did not begin with vijaya-nAma-vyApArin becoming the mahAmlechCharAT. 

The recent Euro-American academe has bred a certain common type among those of European/Euro-West Asian ancestry that loves to conform. We psychoanalyze this as primarily stemming from their non-reversal to a natural religion after their faith in a West Asian counter-religion weakened. Thus, they need things to believe in & feel part of a tradition larger than themselves. navyonmAda satisfies that but there is also an urge to feel heroic in the fight against the shaitan -- probably stemming from the vAsana-s of the counter-religions.

The figure of vijaya vyApArin, the leader of the "deplorables", who are the antithesis to their elite ways, thus crystallized as a dajjal for the like. This goes with the uniquely American tendency to crystallize singular "demonic" adversaries as being pitted against them in their struggle for good: the hAdi-shUlapuruSha, Osama, Putin etc. Thus, for the like of Harris it is pichChila who has to puncture even as all available means are to be used when fighting the hAdi-shUlapuruSha.
