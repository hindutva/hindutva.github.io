      <title>The communists hold outs of India</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/10/02/the-communists-hold-outs-of-india/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently there was a report that the Russians after having buried Stalin’s mummified corpse were going to do the same to Lenin. The Indian commie leaders thundered that it was a desecration of their hero and also the Russian heritage itself. This aspect of the commie hold out in India is reminiscent of the holding out of the sister Abrahmism in India. Christianity is declining in its heartland- Europe (though it still persists as a sub-current ideology) but is vigorously pursued in India. Indians once fooled seem to follow the delusion much after the original fools are cured. One wonders why?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conformity to navyonmAda</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1594947381484982274.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pichChilonmAda+++(=trumpomania)+++ of the American intellectual Sam Harris is not entirely unusual &amp;ndash; it just that he honestly expresses his thoughts in words unlike many others, whose behaviors suggest that they hold ideas very close to him. This did not begin with vijaya-nAma-vyApArin becoming the mahAmlechCharAT.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recent Euro-American academe has bred a certain common type among those of European/Euro-West Asian ancestry that loves to conform. We psychoanalyze this as primarily stemming from their non-reversal to a natural religion after their faith in a West Asian counter-religion weakened. Thus, they need things to believe in &amp;amp; feel part of a tradition larger than themselves. navyonmAda satisfies that but there is also an urge to feel heroic in the fight against the shaitan &amp;ndash; probably stemming from the vAsana-s of the counter-religions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>H-susceptibility</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1638053181857976320&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1638053181857976320.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past parents used to fear the children falling prey to alcohol and other substances or sexual excesses when they went to college but today they have to fear disease of सामाजिकन्यायवाद much more. It destroy not just their children but their whole lineages. But few are aware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The storming of the citadels of science, tech&amp;amp; medicine in the occident by navyonmAda is no surprise to its careful observers. The proclivity towards that disease of the mind was already quite deep even by the 1990s and earlier &amp;ndash;sooner or later the pathogen was to totally take over the host. Similarly, it seems the H have a high degree of natural susceptibility to navyonmAda unlike some of the prAchya peoples. Thus, it ripping through an already immuno-compromised H population is not entirely a matter of surprise. Saw snippets of a video of malla on a H woman&amp;rsquo;s daughters falling to the disease. Nothing unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interesting graphs in this article by Haidt +++(showing sharp rise in mental problems in liberal kids and youth)+++. While Haidt himself likes to play equal-equal it illustrates why we call navyonmAda an unmAda. Ultimately we believe that just like the West Asian unmAda-s, the American unmAda has 2 fold epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are the biological unmatta who spark off a local navyonmAda event like a rAkShasavAdin. These are foci of the infection &amp;ndash; we can with high fidelity just look at the face +++(→ ugliness??)+++ &amp;amp; predict if a person is going to be a navyonmatta before they announce their sarvanAmani &amp;ndash; a sign that a mahAmlechCha is nayvonmatta.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Xi vs Soros</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems the relationship between दुष्ट-सोरः &amp;amp; the chIna-s has soured. The emperor&amp;rsquo;s edict describing him as what he really is was released. Irrespective of where 1 stands vis-a-vis the chIna-s, they are spot on regarding this &amp;amp; as they have been regarding some other issues. He has clearly struck back &amp;amp; we have to see how the chIna-s handle his assault.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is case where enemy&amp;rsquo;s enemy is not friend &amp;ndash; he is as much or more the enemy of H too. It is also important for multiple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
