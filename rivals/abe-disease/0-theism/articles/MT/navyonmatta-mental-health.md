Interesting graphs in this article by Haidt +++(showing sharp rise in mental problems in liberal kids and youth)+++. While Haidt himself likes to play equal-equal it illustrates why we call navyonmAda an unmAda. Ultimately we believe that just like the West Asian unmAda-s, the American unmAda has 2 fold epidemiology. 

There are the biological unmatta who spark off a local navyonmAda event like a rAkShasavAdin. These are foci of the infection -- we can with high fidelity just look at the face +++(â†’ ugliness??)+++ & predict if a person is going to be a navyonmatta before they announce their sarvanAmani -- a sign that a mahAmlechCha is nayvonmatta. 

Then there are the mostly normal people who get infected by the sAhacharyam of the biologically navyonmatta -- the social contagion aspect. This can be seen in every major navyonmatta fad that runs through society.
