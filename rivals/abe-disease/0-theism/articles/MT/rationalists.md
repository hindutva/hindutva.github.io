Dick Dock +++(=Dawkins)+++ is a classic example of a 0-graded pretasAdhaka. A lot of the British "rationalism" and consequently neo-Enlightenment thought in the Occident (and its apers elsewhere in the world, like India) is best explained as emerging from the pretamata's anxiety over phenomena or systems that might challenge their sole right to special authority. E.g., the only accepted supernaturalism was that of the church. 

So the early English "rationalism" directed against things like poltergeists and ghosts and such like phenomena was not due to a fundamentally scientific challenge but because they intruded into to domain assigned solely to the ekarAkShasa by the pretAlaya.
