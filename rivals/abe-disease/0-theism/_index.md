## As a maturation of Abrahamism
- They go: "There’s only one God, and He doesn’t exist."

### Philosophy
- "The original ekarākṣasonmāda-s had a single rakṣas as the object of their worship. They took the jabberings of their unmatta-s — much like one seized by a rākṣasa-graha — to be the very words of this rakṣas and as the basis of their impious systems. Closer to our times, starting with durātman-s Marx and Engels, there arose among the mleccha-s and the ādipraiṣhaka-s a mutation of the old unmāda-s where the **rakṣas count was reduced from 1 to 0**. However, as we have noted before, the rest of the unmāda, such as the **promise of a utopia** on earth or in Lalaland remained intact." - [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/06/08/pandemic-days-the-fizz-is-out-of-the-bottle/)
- "New atheism, Marxism, secularism etc are palpably mutations of Abrahamism where the theic reduction reaches the natural conclusion in 0 from 1. However, it retains the **same counter-heathen definition** inherited without change from Abrahamism." {[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1064698752517226496)} "Like all the prior abrahma-ruj-s, this latest strain retains its inherent **hate for dharma and theoclasm**."
- Via [OGS16](https://twitter.com/OGSaffron/status/796270938195165185) - But that idealism and intellectualism are inseparable is made much clearer in Lewis Feuer's great work "Ideology and the Ideologists”. In "Ideology and the Ideologists", Feuer connects the Mosaic revolutionary myth with Marxism, bridging Abrahamism with secular ideology. "The prototype for the ideologies of intellectuals is the Mosaic \[distinction\].  Maoist, Naxalite, separatist, Marxist ideologies, and so on, which are creations of intellectuals, follow an Abrahamically-rooted scheme." –Lewis Feuer **A people are oppressed, a savior (messiah) or saviors (proletariat) come, there is revolution, liberation, and then “true history" starts**. In other words the liberation meme that's so characteristic of deterministic philosophy and secular ideology actually has religious origins.

### Evolutionary history
- Vicious internal conflicts (eg. protestants vs catholics) amongst or with the Abrahamisms led to the rise of secularism.
- "However, the “pratyakSha” of science kept repeatedly hammering on the “pramANa” of the pretapustaka, with the final blow coming much closer to our times with the publication of the evolutionary theory by Darwin. One would have thought that this blow the pretamata would have no leg to stand on."
- "However, even that did not eradicate the pretamata. Rather, the two apparently contradictory trajectories continued to coexist in the mlechCha world with the strengthening a concept called the separation of the secular from the sacral."
- "This offered an opportunity for the pretamata to not just survive but even expand by pushing both its rapine secularized version that continued to engulf heathen civilizations in the name of various secular constructs and its unadulterated evangelistic form. This aspect is indeed seen by the imposition of the same kind dialog on heathen civilizations like our own wherein we are forced to cut up knowledge by separating secular from sacral \[One might look up this earlier note in this regard\]. This is followed by a trivialization of our sacral structures making it easy for the pretamata \[or for that matter the rAkShasa-mata\] to fill up the ensuing vacuum."  \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/)\]

### Maturation in individuals
- "One might think that one is cured of it but it might have merely has mutated in the infected person’s mind and persist as a different version of the disease even as persistent bacterial infection."

### Instances
- "To the surprise of many H, western liberals while opposed to u2 are even greater enemies of heathenism (e.g. the CEO of Twitter and his agents)."
- "This is also seen with u3 e.g. Pakistanis or B'deshis who shed their religion typically do not become H. They become secular/atheist  and typically retain their old anti-H tendencies intact - thus they are often darlings of those who seek racial but not doctrinal variety." {[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1064698752517226496)}
- "As an example, we have a TSPian ex-marūnmattikā +++(sarah haider)+++, who is popular in mleccha secular circles and even supported by Hindus, who exhibits the same hate for H as a full-blown marūnmatta."
- "Dick Dawkins is another example of the same. Here, the disease has assumed a new persistent form while superficially appearing as though cured."

### Econolatory
- "they worship the faceless market running by its own vrata-s and attribute all human abhyudaya to these magical market forces. They see it as self-correcting and the panacea for all evil — whereas in the past they used see the prathama and dvitīya unmāda-s as the foundation of their well-being they now either additionally or exclusively genuflect towards the miraculous market." - [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/06/08/pandemic-days-the-fizz-is-out-of-the-bottle/)
