## Unsuccessful fightback

- Kalavai Venkat notes: "(Dalai Lama was refused a meeting by Pope Francis because it might annoy China \[[TOI](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/Pope-refuses-to-meet-Dalai-Lama-as-it-would-annoy-China/articleshow/45526567.cms)\].) Prabhupada did the same. He went to the Vatican, and waited for an audition, only to be told that the pope had canceled the meeting. Sri Sri Ravishankar released audios where he had conversations with Jesus. Thich Nhat Hanh facilitated the shoplifting of the Buddhist meditation techniques and repackaging them as Christian meditation. When would these leaders realize an enemy for what he is?"
