## Unsuccessful fightback

> Kalavai Venkat notes: "(Dalai Lama was refused a meeting by Pope Francis because it might annoy China \[[TOI](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/Pope-refuses-to-meet-Dalai-Lama-as-it-would-annoy-China/articleshow/45526567.cms)\].) Prabhupada did the same. He went to the Vatican, and waited for an audition, only to be told that the pope had canceled the meeting. Sri Sri Ravishankar released audios where he had conversations with Jesus. Thich Nhat Hanh facilitated the shoplifting of the Buddhist meditation techniques and repackaging them as Christian meditation. When would these leaders realize an enemy for what he is?"

## Iraqois
> Anno Domini 1625, the young French Jesuit Jean de Brébeuf was sent by his superiors to the province of New France; leaving behind the country of his birth, the missionary priest became one of the daring few who ventured into an untamed continent bearing little more than a keen awareness of the gravity of their mission: to bring the Christian Gospel to the natives. Brébeuf had been chosen for the New World because he had a knack for languages, and so was well equipped for engagement with an altogether alien culture. The assignment proved a wise one, as Brébeuf immersed himself deeply among the Wyandot, or Huron, a tribal confederacy that had gathered on the north shores of Lake Ontario two centuries before. From 1626, the Jesuit père devoted himself as the apostle to the Hurons, with the singular mission of making these people Catholic.

> It was slow work. An ancient pagan religion was ingrained among the Wyandot, and few had much interest in leaving it behind. But Brébeuf learned their language and their ways, and taught them something of his own in turn. By 1636, a decade into Brébeuf’s missionary work, he said he had baptized 86 of the pagan Wyandot. ...
>
> Brébeuf and his fellow Jesuits ministered to the Wyandot another 13 years. Then, under military pressure from the northward-moving Iroquois, the Wyandot and their Jesuit companions found themselves in dire straits. Finally, as the invading Iroquois sacked the mission village of Saint-Louis, Brébeuf and fellow priest Gabriel Lalemant were taken captive. The savage torture to which they were subjected included flaying and—in mockery of the sacrament they had brought to the Wyandot—a baptism in boiling water. At the end of it all, the natives consumed Father Brébeuf’s blood and heart.
>
> The martyrs’ bodies were retrieved and buried at the nearby mission of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, where they had ministered in life. Three months to the day after the priests’ martyrdom at the hands of the Iroquois, the remaining missionaries were forced to evacuate. Rather than leave the church to be desecrated, the Jesuits set the mission ablaze and watched their life’s work crumble as they fled.

## Canada 2021
> Nine Canadian churches, both Catholic and Anglican, have been subjected to arson attacks. Many more have been otherwise vandalized to varying degrees. The popular narrative, broadcast by an astonishingly credulous media, is that previously unknown mass graves of children were discovered just this summer on the grounds of Indian residential schools and, in a rash of grief and righteous anger, indigenous protestors swept across the nation desecrating churches.
