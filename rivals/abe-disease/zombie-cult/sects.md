## Mormons
- Mormon families are similar large.
###  Fertility
- Fertility pattern: Summary from [MF_E15](http://mormonfertility.blogspot.com/).

- 1\. Larger than replacement level numbers of children.   (That is to say significantly higher than 2.1 children per woman, on average).
- 2\. Despite widespread use of contraception. This implies that for Mormons family size is usually chosen deliberately. (By contrast, other religious groups with significantly above-replacement fertility do not allow contraception.)
- 3\. In a group of people who are more educated than average and economically more successful than average.
- 4\. Average fertility (numbers of children) tends to be highest among the most educated and wealthiest Mormons.

### Explanation
The pattern of Mormon fertility could be explained in a general sense as a combination of two forces: one tending to increase family size, the other tending to limit family size.

- 1\. On the one hand, Mormonism encourages large families, yet
- 2\. On the other hand Mormonism encourages what might briefly be described as 'self-reliance' - in the sense that the ideal Mormon family unit should be able (as a rule) to support itself without assistance from outside the family. (Indeed, the Mormon family ought to aim to generate a surplus to use on church activities such as buildings and mission work - it should also be noted that virtually no money goes on salaries, since Mormon Priests (all adult men in good standing), Bishops and Stake Presidents, are all unpaid part-timers - hence indeed they usually subsidise these roles from other jobs.)
- 3\. The combination leads to wealthier Mormon families being the largest, on average, since they can afford to bring up larger numbers of children decently, without using external resources. Presumably poorer Mormons must necessarily limit their family sizes voluntarily by means of contraception.
