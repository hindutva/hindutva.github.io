title = "Conversion causes"
+++

I don't know what "ground work" these 2 sanghis have done but they seem to have no touch with reality & repeating talking pts they get in their bauddhik sessions.

I have been through almost every call recording & video interviews of ex pretas by Shivashakti, reasons for preta success mentioned are family problems like disease,
alcoholism, & finances sometimes. Usually disease or some other family problem are mentioned. Not even SC callers have mentioned jati discrimination as the reason+++(5)+++. That's what u get when u do actual ground work like Shivashakti.

This guy converted as he was in preta school which have been further flourishing thanks to BJP supported laws like RTE. 

Another reason mentioned by serial actress mentioned by Sri Lakshmi on why she almost converted is lack of H education & pracharaks back in day. She & several who came back mentioned influence of Chaganti Koteswar Rao gaaru also through their pravachanas.

This is what you get from an intelligent org doing proper ground work. Publicizing apostates, gathering data from them on y they converted, & what brought them back, not just mindless physical locomotion & beating own drum. 

I am giving a sample - This call is from ex preta guy who converted during lockdown. He used to do this Haridasu, Gangireddu traditions fading profession of his jati. Not sure if they are SC but they definitely are not UC. Why did he convert? Alcoholism & all it took for him to come back was watching 1 vid of Sugguna Karunakar discussing 1 of many unsavory things in pretapustaka. Karunakar notes that pretas seem to be targeting his jati specifically as they are custodians of a visible H tradition of gangireddu (going house to house with decorated bull).

Another sample - Husband started going to pretalaya due to health problems, wife was born into preta family.  They talk in detail about how pastors loot even laborers like them in name of 10% tithe (u have to give 10% of your monthly income to pastor), rice gifts to pastor, doing unpaid work late into night after their labor for free for pretalaya like distributing pamphlets. Not even the greediest brahmana pujari of RSS imaginations will ask u to give 10% of ur income to him.+++(5)+++ 

This institution of pretas is called dasamabhaagam & pastors will
literally fight & abuse each other for stealing their sheep if someone in their pretalaya starts going to another pretalaya. They are losing 10% of person's income. All this is discussed in detail in their vid int with Shivashakthi, both wife & husband became H thanks to Karunakar vids.
