Jesuit missionaries in the 18th century forged a text in French they called the "Ezourvedam" and passed it as an authentic translation of the Yajurveda from Sanskrit by a learned Brahmana. The text showed how the original doctrine of the Brahmins was monotheism & anti-idolatry! This Ezourvedam was given to Voltaire and for the better part of 50 years, it lent the impression to European intellectuals that the religion of the Indians had also opposed idolatrous superstitions at the start. Issac Newton himself thought the Brahmins of India are direct descendants of Abraham and even the word Brahmana comes from Abrahamans (sons of Abraham) and that Abraham instructed the Brahmins in worship of one god without images & sent them to the east. This influenced Voltaire.
