## Introduction

- See [general evaluation here](../abe-disease/).
- The classic baptist condemnation of Hiduism with concepts such as "true vs false gods", "importance of using the right name for god", devil-worship, the coming of the anti-christ etc.. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8nWky51XCc).

### Major Mutations

- Dominant clade: Nicene creed.
- Rex Mundi is a esoteric figure of Templars and other orders, who created this physical world which is evil.
- Regarding non-believers
    - Interestingly, Jehovah's witnesses don't believe in non-witnesses (who've consciously refused to obey jehovah) being ressurrected for torture after judgement. They just won't be resurrected at all.

#### Epistemological atheism

- Aka reactionary atheism.
- NNT said wisely: "Indeed,  Atheism is a sect of Protestantism. (For one to be an atheist, religious "belief" has to be epistemic.) ... Atheism is not part of Paganism.  Atheism is an extreme version of Protestantism."
- Secularism (../Described [separately](../0-theism/secularism/).)

#### More agreeable mutations

- The gnostics were so perplexed with the world as it is that they were convinced that the "God" of the OT must be a wicked being. They called him demiurge/yaldabaoth.
- Cathars considered the rAkshasa of OT as a rAkShasa. They were burned by the pope.
- Quakers believe in continuing revelation, and equal access to the "light" by everyone.
    - "we fully welcome lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people into our fellowship, even though the Bible seems to some on the surface to condemn homosexuality, condone slavery, deny women’s role in ministry, and require outward sacramental practice.  And we remain open to new light, expecting that God will intend further changes for us in the future." \[[Q](http://www.nyym.org/?q=WhatQuakersBelieve)\]

## Strong out-group hostility.

- Anti-heathenism is noted elsewhere.
- Anti-jewish progroms were strongly spurred by christianity, culminating in nAzi doctrine.
    - "Jews and Their Lies" by Martin Luther.
- "Generation Atheist by Dan Riley" contains testimonies from children thrown out of home because of being atheists, the teenager Jessica Ahlquist who successfully challenged Christian indoctrination at Rhode Island Public School and faced threats.

## Exploitation of the "flock"

- Televangelists scamming poor and vulnerable people with faith healing and "send me seed money" prosperity promises, while leading rich lives. [LWT15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xJAVZxXg).
- Church priests raping children.
