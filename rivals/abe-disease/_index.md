"If Hinduism is a single religion, consistency requires Judaism, Xianity & Islam be categorised as sects of a single religion." \- Stietencron  


## Cure
> "Even if one is truly cured of an abrahma-ruj one can have a lifelong chronic inflammatory condition — this is seen among some mleccha atheists and neo-heathens. That inflammatory condition can be seen in the form of destructive dur-vāsana-s persisting among them." See Neo-pagan part of [compatibility page](../../../polity/external-affairs/population-compatibility/).

## History

- The Persian asura/ ahura Mazda may have been a precursor to these intolerant exclusivisms (we have Xerxes describing his destruction of the "daiva" temple-s [here](http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/XPh.html) ).
- "The process by which this came about might be described as follows: In the early tribal period each tribe would have had its own patron god; when kingship emerged the state promoted Yahweh as the national god of Israel, supreme over the other gods, and gradually Yahweh absorbed all the positive traits of the other gods and goddesses; finally, in the national crisis of the exile, the very existence of other gods was denied."
- Akenaton's Aten monotheism.

## Common politico military expressions

- "The Habsburg monarch Karl (Charles) V saw himself as the lord of the Catholics leading them in the crusade against infidels. The tsar of Russia Ivan IV saw himself as the lord of the orthodox church leading them in their own religious war. In the Mohammedan world Suleyman was accompanied by Shah Ismail of Iran who saw himself as a jihadist for the Shia cause. Further east, Padishah Akbar saw himself as the true ghazi who was rooting out the kaffirs of Hind. The trajectory each of these took was to set the tune of history to this date.

    - Via [TW16](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/545075128212926464): The duty of our Government is, as I said, to take no part in the disputes between Mahometans and idolaters. But, if our Government does take a part, there cannot be a doubt that Mahometanism is entitled to the preference.- "The Gates of Somnauth" A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 9TH OF MARCH 1843 by Thomas Babington Macaulay [CU](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/oOgenerallinks/macaulay/txt_commons_somnauth_1843.html), [GU](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2170)

##### Java
> "Dr. Margana fascinatingly described that most of Blambangan royal family originated from Balinese origin. For the Balinese, Blambangan symbolize the last cushion against Islamization into the island of Bali. In the context, the Company government in Java Oosthoek arranged the plan to encourage the Islamizing of the Blambangan people, in order to prevent any Balinese’s intervene efforts and any reappearance of an anti-Dutch movement in Blambangan. ... Furthermore, Javanese-Muslim rulers of Mataram and their vassals attempted intermittent  to exert control over the region, which aroused the two vexations. In addition, he critically argued that the Javanese kings stood for colonization that alienating the Blambangan people, draining them of any primordial feelings of being Javanese. In this sense, “professing to be Javanese by this time meant being both Muslim and colonized.” To conclude, in the case of VOC occupation of Blambangan, Islam was played a significant place in expansion of Dutch collonialism in Java. In contrast, the Hindu community was have considerable resistances against the Dutch."

#### Judaist-muslim alliances
> "Having survived the battery at the hands of the Christian holy warrior Janos Hunyadi, the Osmans recovered and expanded again under Bayazid-II. In course of his reign he brought many Judaists who had been evicted from Spain and settled them in the Osman empire, resulting a deep alignment between them and the Mohammedans. ... Nevertheless, he settled several Jews in the region and they had a symbiotic relationship with him as he appointed one of them as his dentist and others as financial helpers." \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/07/22/turning-of-the-turkic-wheel-unmattabhisa%E1%B9%83dhi-battles-won-battles-lost-and-march-of-marunmada/)\]
