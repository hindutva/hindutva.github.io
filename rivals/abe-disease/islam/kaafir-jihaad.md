## Motivating Concepts

- Motivating Terrorism
    - KE: "Thus, when Mohammed Atta, Mohammed Bouyeri and hundreds of other Muslim terrorists declare in their farewell letters/videos that their motive is Islam, we have to believe them. But when they talk about Islam, claiming that their own interpretation is the same as Prophet Mohammed’s, we have to ascertain for ourselves the truth of that claim. And then we find that Prophet Mohammed’s intention was indeed closer to al-Qaeda’s than to that of the Sufis, a movement which invokes Quranic authority but was quite unknown in Mohammed’s day."
- Pan-Islamic Caliphate
    - "Choudary’s colleague Abu Baraa explained that Islamic law permits only temporary peace treaties, lasting no longer than a decade. Similarly, accepting any border is anathema, as stated by the Prophet and echoed in the Islamic State’s propaganda videos. If the caliph consents to a longer-term peace or permanent border, he will be in error. Temporary peace treaties are renewable, but may not be applied to all enemies at once: the caliph must wage jihad at least once a year. He may not rest, or he will fall into a state of sin." \[[ISIS1](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
    - "The caliph is required to implement Sharia. Any deviation will compel those who have pledged allegiance to inform the caliph in private of his error and, in extreme cases, to excommunicate and replace him if he persists." \[[ISIS1](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
- Ushering in the apocalypse
    - "Now that it has taken Dabiq, the Islamic State awaits the arrival of an enemy army there, whose defeat will initiate the countdown to the apocalypse." \[[ISIS1](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
- Extra-territorial loyalty.

### Fostering the victim mentality.

#### Techniques

- Omission of the first offense - 
  - Forgetting Godra train burning in case of gurjarat riots.
  - Eg. Forgetting the initial destruction of rAm temple in case Babri masjid demolition
- Fake images of Ronghiya persecution in Burma
    - Fake image of a supposedly ronghiya child suckling at the breast of a dead woman (turns out to be from a nepAlI movie). \[[NepMovFake](http://www.reddit.com/r/1000words/comments/1cwrm1/burman_child_tries_to_drink_from_his_dead_mothers/)[FB2015](https://www.facebook.com/shruti.jagdeesh/posts/10155560799370133)[BBC2015](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32979147)\].

## Glacial and whirlwind modes

- "To use someone’s words marūnmāda can advance both as a glacier and a whirlwind. We can see both strategies simultaneously at play. For example, the Moslem Brotherhood takes the glacial approach whereas the Khilafat under Dr. Abu Bakr takes the whirlwind approach. The same marūnmatta group can shift from one approach to another depending on the opportunities. Moreover, virulent strains of marūnmāda can persist even after a defeat with alternative strategies." \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/07/09/a-geopolitical-package-july-2016/)\]
- "For example Abd al-Wahab and Muhammad bin Saud and their successors founded the hellhole of Saudi Arabia by means of whirlwind Jihad campaigns paralleling those of Abu Bakr’s Khilafat of today. Their atrocities in Iraq by described the English observers are no different from those of the current Khilafat or any other Jihad. But the Osman Khilafat saw them as competitors and together with their Egyptian allies crushed the Saud. Then the Saud shifted gears to being quiescent like bacteria expressing the toxins from a toxin-antitoxin system until eventually they had the classic opportunity of a mleccha-marūnmattābhisaṃdhi to ally with the Anglosphere, reestablish their power and regain most of their territory." \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/07/09/a-geopolitical-package-july-2016/)\]

## Genocide

- "Sultan Tughlak's systematic slaughter of Hindus. It is recorded that in the 12th or 13 century Sultan Firoz Shaw invaded Bengal and offered a reward for every Hindu head, subsequently paying for 180,000 of them. Whenever in his territory the number of Hindus killed in one day totaled 20,000, Sultan Ahmad Shah celebrated with a three-day feast." Durant (1954, p. 461) quoted [here](http://hawaii.edu/powerkills/DBG.CHAP3.HTM).
- Mass murder of non-compliant Yazidi-s by ISIS (2014). \[[slaughter](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/18/us-iraq-security-yazidis-idUSKBN0GI1QK20140818?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews)\]
- In India
    - 1946 Direct action day - Muslim league encouragement \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/776269924541005824)\]
    - kalAsha:
        - "Most of these people were exterminated in 1895-96 by Mohammedans after the Durand line was drawn. A few 1000 Kalash remained as they fell on the British Indian side of the Durand line. Nuristan (province of light) was then called Kafiristan." - SP.

## Castration, rape and enslavement.

### Women
#### Precedent and history
- Muhammad himself practiced this. 
- Early muslim expansion into central Asia offers several gory examples ([M](http://www.indiafacts.co.in/isis-caliphate-lessons-earliest-mohammedan-invasions-central-asia/)).
- Boko Haram captures schoolgirls of Nigeria (2014) and forces them to Islam + marriage with jihadis ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibok_schoolgirls_kidnapping)).
- Islamic State sells captured Yazidi women in Iraq (2014) \[[Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/yazidis-tormented-fears-for-women-girls-kidnapped-sinjar-isis-slaves)\].

#### Theological justification
- Kuwaiti Political Activist Salwa Al Mteiri ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Sc2uoJ5f8), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoBcFWUTze0))
- "Professor" Suad Saleh of Al-Azhar University [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj-Bx4SYufA).

#### Mob practices
- " In taḥarrush, They surround the victim in circles. The men in the inner circle are the ones who physically abuse the woman, the next circle are the spectators, while the mission of the third circle is to distract and divert attention to what's going on."
- "[A 2013 study](http://harassmap.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Reconceptualizing-Sexual-Harassment-in-Egypt.pdf) informs us that 98% of foreign women who visit Egypt have been sexually molested: http://harassmap.org/…/Reconceptualizing-Sexual-Harassment-… . Local women only fare marginally better: 83% of Egyptian women are molested."
- "Muslim gangs of 500-1,000 men had targeted German women in Cologne on New Year's Eve in a brutal enactment of taḥarrush in which 90 women were sexually assaulted. One should've seen this coming. " \[[FB](https://www.facebook.com/KalavaiVenkat/posts/1669293833350986), [S](http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.2374/german-police-it-s-an-arab-rape-game-called-taharrush-and-now-it-has-come-to-europe.html), [YT1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=21&v=gMGQAbEA23Q)\]

#### Consequences
- Increased practice of suicide (assisted or otherwise) to prevent women from being taken as sex slaves.
- In India, this led to increased jIvahara (jowhar)/ sati.
- Sikh example during the partition - [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQtUYv1_-s).

## Barring Hindu spiritual practice

"The wicked mlecchas pollute the religion of the Hindus every day. They break the images of the gods into pieces and throw away the articles of worship. They throw into fire Bhagavata Purana and other holy scriptures. They forcibly take away a conch shell and bell of the brahmanas, and lick the sandal paints of their bodies. They urinate like dogs on the sacred Tulasi plant and deliberately pass faeces in the Hindu temples. They would throw water from their mouths on the Hindus engaged in worship, and harass the Hindu saints as if they were so many lunatics let large." - Isana Nagara, (c. 1564), author of the Advaita-prakasa, describes contemporary condition of the Hindus under 'Ala-ud-din Hussain Shah (1493–1519)
