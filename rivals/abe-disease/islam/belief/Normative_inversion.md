### Sirhindi
> Sirhindi follows up his utter rejection of the beliefs and practices of Hinduism with an equally outspoken statement of his attitude regarding the position of the Hindus in the Mughul empire. The honour of Isl훮m demands the humiliation of the infidels and their false religion. To achieve this objective, jizyah should be mercilessly levied upon them, and they should be treated like dogs. 
> 
> -Cows should be slaughtered to demonstrate the supremacy of Isl훮m. The performance of this rite is, in India, the most important symbol of Islamic domination. 
> 
> One should refrain from dealing with the infidels unless absolutely necessary, and even then treat them with contempt. Isl훮m and infidelity are two irreconcilable opposites. One thrives upon the degradation of the other.
> 
> Sirhindi's deep-seated hatred of the non-Muslims can be best illustrated by his rejoicing at the execution in 1606 of Arjun, the fifth guru of the Sikhs. In a letter to Shaykh Farid Bukh훮ri Sirhindi says: "These days the accursed infidel of Govindwal was very fortunately killed. It is a cause of great defeat for the reprobate Hindus. With whatever intention and purpose they are killed, the humiliation of infidels is for the Muslims life itself'
