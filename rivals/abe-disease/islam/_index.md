title: +Islam मरून्मादः
---

TL;DR : Muslim society is undesirable, despite a supposedly tolerant yet silent majority.

## Intro
Islam is the third major strain of Abraham's disease, where a "bug" in the previous versions (that there can be multiple prophets) was fixed by making Muhammad the final prophet. 

## Disclaimers and clarifications

<div class="videoEmbed"  caption="" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtVJe4eFGDk"></div>


- We are not saying that all muslims are bad people - many are sensible enough not follow the example of their prophet or strictures of Qur'an. Yet, we say that Islam is a vile ideological disease, and should be contained for our own sake.
- Please don't presume to psychoanalyze me and read hatred of muslims. On the contrary, we have no problems empathizing with Muslims at a human level. It is by a good accident of birth that I was not born a muslim. Many of us grew up with muslim friends, and have had many polite (sometimes frank) conversations with muslims.
    - We have received help from and have helped muslims. Further, we understand that Islam is not the only motivator of the good and bad actions of muslims.
- Our judgement of Islam is not restricted to what its liberal or the terrorist extremes do - it includes the entire spectrum (= probability distribution) of behavior observed in Muslims and Muslim societies.

## Undesirability of Muslim society

- Muslim society has a pernicious effect on non-muslim (especially polytheistic) societies. These are detailed in a [separate section](../constituent-subversion/).
- Muslim society is bad for muslims themselves, in the long run. More in the [fitness-effect page](../fitness-effect/).
