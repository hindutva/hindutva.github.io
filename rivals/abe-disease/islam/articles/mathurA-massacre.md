A first person narrative of the mass killing of Hindus of Mathura by Ahmed Shah Abdali in 1757. These narratives were written by Ghulam Hasan Samin and translated into English by William Irvine in the vol. 36 of Indian Antiquary in 1907. The details are gory. 

In Mathura, they did mass scale killing of Hindu ascetics. They killed cows as well and tied the severed head of the cows around the neck of killed ascetics in a way that dead cow's head touched the mouth of slain ascetics.

In the adjoining areas of Mathura and Vrindavan, two associates of Abdali had carried out mass scale killing to the extent that there were nothing but corpses. At one place, more than 200 children were killed and thrown in the heap. Mathura which was a flourishing commercial center was completely destroyed. The streets were filled with corpses and the city was burned. A Muslim merchant was spared when he proved his Muslim identity that shows how killing was driven by Islamic zeal.
