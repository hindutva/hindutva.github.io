One thing many people don't entirely apprehend is that marUnmAda operates on it own "wave length". The common considerations of a "rational" player don't entirely apply to it because it lives entirely within the unmAda. 

It should be noted that the Abrahamistic conquest of the Europeans, despite its thoroughness, was not complete in some domains. For e.g. many European nations retained maintained fragments of old IE law & governance intact even after being subjugated by West Asian ekarAkShasonmAda. This is hardly so for a society engulfed by marUnmAda. It is left with only sharia & apparatus of mahAmada in its wake. 

That's why marUnmatta-s from the western or eastern flanks, even upon apparently becoming cured of the unmAda often don't really come out of it -- they hang like trisha~Nku rather than doing a simple ghar-vApasi.
