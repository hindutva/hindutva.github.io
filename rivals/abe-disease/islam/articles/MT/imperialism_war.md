>>Islamist extremists perpetrated 31,221 terror attacks and killed 146,811 people worldwide since 9/11, said the reputed German newspaper @welt in 2019 in its incredible report "18 Years of Terror".

Western imperialism is only one part and perhaps even the smaller aspect of it;  
in the west and Israel many people are also acutely aware of an intra-Abrahamistic conflict,  
which is distinct from the former. 

But above all of these is the unfinished "ghazvat al hind", which is foundational for we are not "people of the book." If are talking of "settler-colonists" we should note that historically the Army of Islam in India attracted ghAzI-s from all over dAr al-islam. Why else would an Iraqi of Turkic ancestry like Khwaja Mahmud Gawan find himself in south India, or ghAzI bAbA-s ride out swinging with their massive clubs well before the main army.

Why that has not happened much in modern times is that states like the Arabs or Iran have crucial economic ties with India that their leadership would not want to disrupt -- brings them little in return. Indonesia is a more complicated case with its H past and deeper ties to India.

I suspect our we are going to see this from different lenses. How one understands the "most of the Muslim world" is the operational part. Pakistan & BD are huge fractions of it. We do see them as mentally at war with H, i.e., a decisive fraction therein will be happy to end the H. As for the rest, I agree H might not be their top priority but given the doctrinal position regarding heathens/polytheists we have every reason to have some concern. As for the progressives, when push comes to shove, they'll side with Islam. Hence, we are not too moved by their faux love for us in a powerless state.
