>  Quran preaches if anyone kills an innocent human being itâ€™s as though as he killed whole humanity.

Muslims always quote Quran 5:32 leaving out the small detail: It does not apply to transgressor and according to Islam all Non-Muslims are transgressors cause they disapprove of Allah's final msg.

> We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors.

Also why didn't u share the next verse which calls for killing non-believers.  That is not me saying but Holy Quran Sura An-Nisa Ayaat 115 and 116.

> And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination.

> Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray.


And while you are at it stop the Al-Taqiyya and start doing what Allah instructed in Sura Al-Bakr Ayaat 190-193

> Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.
> 
> And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.
>
> Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah . But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors.

The prophet himself ordered beheading of 600-800 Jews of Banu Qurayza. He ordered execution of Asma and Umm Qurfa. He himself stated.that he was made victorious through casting terror in hearts of disbelievers ( Bukhari 2977).
