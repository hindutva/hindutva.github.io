Iran appears to have the world's highest rate of lifetime infertility because it also has the world's highest rate of STD infections.

Iran, like other Middle Eastern countries, has an extremely high infertility rate. More than 20 percent of Iranian couples cannot conceive, according to a study conducted by one of the country's leading fertility clinics, compared with the global rate of between 8 and 12 percent. Experts believe this is due to the prevalence of consanguineous marriages, or those between cousins. Male infertility is "the hidden story of the Middle East," says Marcia Inhorn, a Yale University medical anthropologist and a specialist on assisted reproduction in the region. 

Kashmir Valley has around 15.7% infertility.

## STD

A 2013 paper by a team of Iranian researchers, "Effects of Chlamydia trachomatis Infection on Fertility: A Case Control Study," observes:

> The molecular prevalence of C. trachomatis was 12.6% in woman in Tehran, the capital of Iran, and in another study it was 21.25% in women attending Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. Considering the different prevalence rates of C. trachomatis infection in Iran, it is vitally essential to assess the impact of C. trachomatis on the reproductive health of women. 

21.25%. 1 in 5 women. World avg is 4.3%
