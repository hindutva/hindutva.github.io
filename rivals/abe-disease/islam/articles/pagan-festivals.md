Why Jihadists Wage War on Christmas (and Other Holidays)?

> “Islamists… despise any holiday not sanctioned by Islam.”

Islamic theologians of the Middle Ages set out the general approach. Ibn Taymiya (1263-1328) argued that joining non-Muslims in their festivals is equivalent to “agreeing to infidelity.” His student Ibn al-Qayyim (1292-1350) specified that congratulating non-Muslims on their holidays “is a greater sin than congratulating them for drinking wine, having illegal sexual intercourse, and so on.”

Of all infidel holidays, Islamic authorities most detest Christmas, when Christians believe God became man. As historian Raymond Ibrahim has noted, these theologians, who believe that polytheism is the ultimate sin in Islam, consider Christmas “the biggest crime ever committed by humanity.”
