Origin Dawoodi Bohra belief system comes from the Fatimids of Egypt. Fatimids were Ismaili Shias who ruled Egypt and North Africa for about 300 years (900-1200AD). There were splits prior to the Fatimids and during the Fatimids. One branch of the Fatimids are the Nizaris (today’s Aga Khanis), other is Mustali which are Bohras.
During the reign of Mustansir (circa 1000 AD - an Imam for the Bohras) missionaries were sent to Gujarat. They managed to convert a few. Thats how it started. The early converts were not known as Bohras. That wouldve happened later.">

  <p>From : Yusuf Unjhawala</p>
<h2 id="origin">Origin</h2>
<p>Dawoodi Bohra belief system comes from the Fatimids of Egypt. Fatimids were Ismaili Shias who ruled Egypt and North Africa for about 300 years (900-1200AD). There were splits prior to the Fatimids and during the Fatimids. One branch of the Fatimids are the Nizaris (today&rsquo;s Aga Khanis), other is Mustali which are Bohras.</p>
<p>During the reign of Mustansir (circa 1000 AD - an Imam for the Bohras) missionaries were sent to Gujarat. They managed to convert a few. Thats how it started. The early converts were not known as Bohras. That wouldve happened later.</p>
<p>Saladdin overthrew the Fatimid rulers. The Imam went into hiding and remains so. But he had appointed a viceregent known as Dai in Yemen. There were 23 such Dai from Yemen. With Zaidi persecution in Yemen, the Dai in Yemen appointed one in Gujarat. the 27th Dai is where the split happened. The ones in Yemen largely went with Suleiman who was the rep of Yemen appointed by the 26th Dai after he claimed to be the successor. Those in India&rsquo;s went with Dawood. Akbar ruled in favour of Dawood.</p>
<p>Bohras didn’t convert by force.
Early converts didn’t form the sect known as Bohra.  It was just Shia Fatimid belief system at that time with missionaries coming from Egypt. The first converts a 1000 years ago - named Bharmal and Tarmal are said to be ministers of Sidhraj Jaisingh. Sidhpur is named after Sidhraj who founded it and built the Rudramahal there.</p>
<p>So Bharmal &amp; Tarmal converted to the Shia Fatimid  belief system. Being ministers, they could’ve influenced others. Along the way that community would’ve included traders or would’ve taken to trading using their proximity to the various rulers.</p>
<p>The early converts could’ve traded with Fatimid Egypt and found favour, influencing more. I am only speculating. Fatimids had trade ties with India and they were a trading empire. The importance of trading for the Fatimids would’ve made its way into the preaching by the missionaries.</p>
<p>For most part, Bohra surnames are related to the village/town/city of their origin or business, or nature of their business - both of their ancestors.</p>
<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Bohra&rdquo; came from the business profession. Vohra = Bohra. Just the way ppl pronounce. In fact Bohras themselves pronounce as Hora. Usage as - aa Horabhai chhe. Have Horaji ne kaun samjhave.</p>
<p>Parsis are of Persian origin, Bohras are of Indian origin - converts from Hindus. The similarities between them is both communities are largely business people and the “wala” in their surnames 😊</p>
<h2 id="identity">Identity</h2>
<p>Ok, let me unpack some things, from what I make of it. Bohras have consciously and constantly tried to project a distinct identity - one that is progressive, business-oriented, and peace-loving. Patriotism, loyalty to the land they live in, is an article of faith for them, as they live around the world. Invariably in their sermons, the clerics say - be loyal to the land you live in.</p>
<p>This projection of distinct identity is perhaps borne out of their survival mechanism being a minority within a minority, within a minority that&rsquo;s just about 5 lakhs in India and another 5 lakhs spread around the world. Like the dress they wear with the men in whites with their style of topi, and the women wearing colourful &ldquo;rida&rdquo; replete with laces, embroidery and other kinds of work.</p>
<p>Coming out in that dress for the now very public presence at Modi events over the last 11 years around the world is to show that. They don&rsquo;t want to be clubbed with others. One is due to the inherent ideological divide of Shia-Sunni, and the other is dissociation from violence in the name of religion. They were impacted in the 1992 and 2002 riots. Sure, a fire doesn&rsquo;t discriminate when it spreads, but this is what I think is the thought process in projecting this distinct identity. And of course, their leadership wants to perpetuate power.</p>
<p>Because the Bohras project a distinct identity and chart their course, others call them non-muslims. I can tell with certainty that the devout ones are as devout as one can get. While the rest of the muslim world looks out for the moon for Ramzan and Id and sometimes fast for 29 days, Bohras by default fast for 30 days. They follow a fixed calendar. They shut their business for 9 days during Moharram to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Husain. Going for Haj, Umrah, Karbala, and other places of pilgrimage - invariably multiple times, especially to centres in India, is part of their religious life.</p>
<p>Religiosity has increased over the last two decades, and in my opinion, this trend is concerning as it diverts an excessive amount of time and money from business activities. However, a significant number of people have quietly become irreligious. Their involvement in the community is primarily for family, socialising, and business purposes.</p>
<p>The above is my assessment, coming from the community. People are free to make their judgement. But not hate. ☺️☺️</p>
<h2 id="sects-and-locus">Sects and Locus</h2>
<p>Worldwide count of Bohras said to be about 10 lakh. Half of them in India. The population growth rate is likely below replacement level. <a href="https://x.com/acigen/status//acigen/status/1716729126856614156">https://x.com/acigen/status//acigen/status/1716729126856614156</a></p>
<p>In India, Bohra community is just 5 lakhs out of 140 Cr. They aren’t a votebank for anybody.</p>
<p>Bohra samaj ma Sidhpuri ane Surati na vacche one upmanship chalti rahe chhe.</p>
<p>Vadodara is also the base for a splinter group of Dawoodi Bohras - known as Alavi Bohras. The split happened over the succession of the 28th Bohra Syedna about 400 years ago.</p>
<p>So called “progressive Bohras” who were against the Bohra leadership and the Bohra ways and rituals, apart from how community funds were collected &amp; used. They are right about community funds, but otherwise found some of them to be fundamentalists on their discussion forum.</p>
<p>Burhanpur is a very important pilgrim centre for the Dawoodi Bohra. They have built good facilities over the years for the pilgrims. Apparently, a big centre to “cure” those “possessed by evil spirits”. Even the local Hindus put their faith in the saint buried there for cure.</p>
<p>Cities in the south attract Bohra businessmen &amp; professionals, but don’t have very high population. Bangalore has about 3-4k. Chennai maybe 6-7k. Secunderabad/Hyderabad and Coimbatore. Entire south might have 20-25k. Migration out of India also happening.</p>
<p>Karachi estimated to have about 50,000. Cities with significant Bohra population in India - Mumbai, Surat, Ahmedabad, Indore, Udaipur, Ujjain, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Dahod.</p>
<h2 id="leadership">Leadership</h2>
<p>Bohras dont follow Iranian leader. The “supreme leader” for the Bohra is the Syedna who is an Indian and lives in India.</p>
<p>The person wearing the headgear (paagri) shows he is a “sheikh”, a title given by the Syedna. A coveted title for Bohras - a status symbol. That they’ve arrived ₹₹$$££ 😊</p>
<p>Bohra Syednas are from Hindu lineage &amp; acknowledged as such. One of the early &amp; revered Bohra Pir Fakhruddin was a convert and said to be the ancestor of the current Syedna.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>Evening or weekend classes to teach basics like namaz and Quran. And perhaps brainwashing to get absolute submission to the leader 😂😂</p>
<p>There is an ICSE board school for Bohras. They don’t have many students. Bohra kids go to pvt schools - largely Christian ones I would imagine.</p>
<p>BTW PM Modi recently inaugurated a Bohra academy. But this one does teaches Arabic in-depth, and all other subjects. They get top management gurus among others paying lakhs to speak to the students. Output is next gen of clerics that control the Bohras for the leadership. I saw the one in Surat 15 odd years ago. Had state of the art facilities that international schools might not have today. Audio-visual equipment, sports facilities, swimming pool, gym, horse riding etc. Sadly, end product is one that serves the leadership to control the Bohras</p>
<h2 id="political-affiliation">Political affiliation</h2>
<p>Md Burhanuddin passed away 10 years ago. In his time as the leader, I never heard him or any of his reps ask to vote for any particular party. Nor have I heard his son and the present leader.</p>
<p>There is ZERO political discourse in Bohra sermons, in mosques.</p>
<p>Bohras being business people - well largely, go with whoever is in power. Nothing different from all the big industrialists. It’s a survival mechanism for a community that’s a minority within the minority within the minority!  5 lakh spread all over India are neither “sons of the soil” as migrants from their home state of Gujarat, nor relevant to any caste arithmetic or anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jinnah had full support for his Pakistan move from the Bohra clergy.</p></blockquote>
<p>“It&rsquo;s Bohra doctrine to support govt of every nation where they live.”</p>
<p>It’s loyalty to the nation, than gvt. Bohras will work with any gvt of the day. They say it in sermons on various occasions - to be loyal to whichever country they reside in - “hubbul watan menal iman”.</p>
<h2 id="friction-with-other-muslims">Friction with other muslims</h2>
<p>Bohras in India predate Mughals. Aurangzeb was a Sunni fundamentalist who persecuted Shia Bohras and went on the execute one of the Bohra Syedna whose grave is in Ahmedabad. Aurangzeb executed Bohra Syedna of the time and many others from the community in Amdavad - calling them “Rafzi” or rejectors. Not only Aurangzeb, but other Muslim rulers too went after the Bohras during their rule.</p>
<p>Bohras faced persecution from Mughals, other local Muslim rulers in India. Aurangzeb executed the 32nd Bohra Syedna accusing him of being a “Rafzi” - rejector. One Bohra peer was thrown alive into boiling oil by another local Muslim ruler. There are many such who were killed.</p>
<p>A Bohra mosque was bombed in Karachi a few years back.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Bohra Syedna somehow paid obeisance at the grave of Fatema,Prophet’s daughter. Saudis were livid with possibility of repercussions for the community. The community did suffer as the leadership took it towards conservatism. A progressive community started going back. The Bohra leadership took a turn in the 1980s when there was a threat of the Saudis declaring them non-Muslim.</p>
<p>In Bohra lingo, “Miyabhai” means Sunnis. Although for non-Muslims, miyabhai means all Muslims. Bohras are Shias. They don’t want to be clubbed with Sunnis</p>
<h3 id="repurcussions">Repurcussions</h3>
<p>in 2002, apparently the line was “Mia ne maro Vohra ne looto” (my cousin lost it all). Since then, Bohras developed close ties with Modi. Done work like check dams in GJ.</p>
<h3 id="waqf">Waqf</h3>
<p>Interestingly, @narendramodi says that when he thought about reforming Waqf, he first consulted with the Bohra leader as he was aware of the issues the community was facing with Waqf. Member of the Bohra delegation says Waqf board stole their land in Bhendi Bazar in Mumbai.</p>
<p>The Bohra leadership’s support Waqf amendment and ask for not being governed by the Waqf Act is driven by self interest. All trusts and their properties by default belongs to the leader. All erstwhile private trusts of individuals from community members were taken over several decades ago.</p>
<p>The Aghakhanis may have their own reasons for supporting the Waqf amendment. They too might be impacted by the earlier law where Waqf staked claim over their properties, like the Bohras stated in their meeting with the PM.</p>
<p>Pasmandas may have their reasons. Likely loss of land to the upper caste of the community. And them wanting a say in the running of community affairs among other reasons.</p>
<h2 id="marriage">Marriage</h2>
<p>Divorce rates among Bohras have also shot up in the last few years for a variety of reasons. The Bohra mechanism for divorce is first to prevent by counselling by elders, clergy. But ultimately it is by consensus after due time. Nothing by WhatsApp, Facebook etc</p>
<h2 id="death-ritual">Death ritual</h2>
<p>Bohra rituals are derived from their Hindu past. Unfortunately, the last few decades has seen “Arabisation” after the 1980s and which nearly led to Saudis branding Bohras as non Muslims. Also the focus is too Syedna centric &amp; nothing else gets discussed incl the past</p>
<p>I witnessed the antim sanskar in person and up-close. A close business associate’s father passed away.</p>
<p>Like many other Bohra rituals, I found striking similarities between some of the rituals of Bohras and the antim sanskar. Now I am sure there will be some variance in rituals according to different Hindu communities and region. I witnessed this in Delhi, the last rites of a Gupta community person. It was the traditional way of a Chita near Yamuna tat, and not electric crematorium. Also a disclaimer that I have not witnessed last rites of other Muslim communities and don’t know how they go about it.</p>
<p>Here are what I found similar:</p>
<p>1- Pre Antyesti, at home - family, friends and others gathering around the deceased offering prayers. Seeing the face for the last time (esp for the women of the house) before being covered with kafan, and asking for forgiveness for anything they might have done.</p>
<p>2- Considering it a kind of duty and punya karya to carry the arthi on the shoulders.</p>
<p>3- Snan. This is not only by Bohras, but all Muslims have a ritual bathing of the dead.</p>
<p>4- Putting honey on the mouth of the deceased.</p>
<p>5- Putting Ganga jal on the body. It’s Zamzam water for Bohras.</p>
<p>6- Opening up of knots that were tied.</p>
<p>7- Again one last time to see the face and pay respects.</p>
<p>8- Those present at the Chita, put mud over the body and also small pieces of wood, symbolic of giving a hand in the last rites. For Bohras and for Muslims in general, everyone present put mitti and flowers.</p>
<p>9- An all male affair. I think this is common to most communities.</p>
<p>10- The immediate relatives stood in one line and those attending the last rites walk passed them hands folded offering condolences. The Bohras give taziyat - its three hugs. Some rub their hands on the back of the relative as a way to condole, comfort and say sabar karjo.</p>
<p>11- Post this, the rituals of uthavani and tervi (13th day after passing). Bohras have Tirajyu (3rd), nomyu (9th), weesmu (20th), maasmu (30th), chalismu (40th), chhammasi (6 months) and varsi (anniversary).</p>
<p>12- “Baithna” at the house of the deceased in the days after the death to condole - mostly women to women.</p>
<p>Cultural and ritual similarities endure in some form or derivatives, despite the changes in form of worship. Be it birth, marriage, various aspects in life, and in death.</p>
<h3 id="iddat">Iddat</h3>
<p>The way Bohra women have to  observe iddat if their husbands pass away is nothing short of torture. Imagine a woman loses her husband and then subjected to solitary confinement. Enclosed in the four walls of her room, can’t see her own self in the mirror, shouldn’t even see the face of any “non mehram” man, even at a distance &amp; no man should hear her voice. If that  happens, the term is reset till “flawlessly” completed. I don’t know how other Muslims observe, but Bohra practice is torture for the bereaved women.</p>
