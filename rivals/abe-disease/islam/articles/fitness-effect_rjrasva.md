## Higher fitness when among kufrs
- When Mohammedans r embedded in a population enthralled by limp ideologies liberalism, feminism, objectivism etc. It can actually enhance /1   the fitness of a # of them & their group. **Kufr produces wealth for them to produce kids**, or they may be inspired to acts of jihad like /2   capturing kufr women & produce kids thru them.

- Eventually the **returns may become -ve after every1 becomes Mohammedan** as they will then turn to slaughtering each other on /6   who the \*true\* Mohammedans r.

## Pyramid-scheme transfer of benefits
- There is also the **pyramid scheme element**, those who enter earlier (e.g. Arabs) get greater benefits. Thus a /7   recent Black African convert will enter as a lowly foot soldier, he won't be getting a train full of bibi's like the arab sheikhs. Recent /8   e.g. is IS using subcontinental recruits for toilet cleaning or tricking them into suicide bombings while giving > status to Arabs. /end
