Jake Bilardi : the "atheist" ISIS suicide bomber -

Do you know any young boys and girls who claim to be atheists? Then you should read this..


Jake Billardi, from Melbourne, Australia was a shy 13 year old. He was a firm atheist and interested in political science. He wanted to be a political journalist.

But his mother had recently passed away and he found out physics or chemistry didn't give him spiritual succour. 

In this vulnerable state, he was taken to an Islamic center in Melbourne by his friends. He was immediately impressed by Islam's political ideology. All the atheism was forgotten in a second and he started exploring Islam.

In 2014, at 15, he was assembling bombs at home! Before he could attack Melbourne, he managed to make contact with ISIS & escaped to join them in Iraq. Next year he carried out a suicide bombing that only killed him.

The writing he left behind fits into the whole atheist revolutionary spiel too. He wanted Azaadi, freedom. His ideas were more in line with what we see our youth espouse and not in line with Islamist extremism. But he was an empty vessel ready to be filled with whatever poison anyone would pour into him. Jarring similarity with our own "atheists" celebrating deaths of Hindus, no? END
