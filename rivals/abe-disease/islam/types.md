## Legal divisions
{{< figure src="../images/Maddhab_Map2.png" title="Maddhab map" >}}

- Current Islamic jurisprudence largely affirms the purported intolerant attitudes.

### Prominent sunni schools

- Hanbali jurisprudence is considered very strict and conservative, especially regarding questions of creed. Hanbali school holds that the two primary sources of Islamic law are the Qur'an and the prophetic tradition; the Hanbali school is known for its strong emphasis on verifying and utilizing the latter on equal ground with the former, whereas other schools granted the tradition a secondary role.
- Hanafi : The sources from which the Hanafis derive Islamic law are, in order of importance and preference: the [Qur'an](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an), the authentic narrations of the Muslim prophet [Muhammad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad) ([hadith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith)), consensus of the Muslim community ([ijma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijma)), analogical reasoning ([qiyas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiyas)), juristic discretion ([istihsan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istihsan)) and the customs of the local population enacting said law ([urf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urf)).
- Shafi'i: In hierarchical order, the usul al-fiqh consist of: the Quran, the Sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, ijmā' ("consensus"), and qiyas ("analogy").
- Maliki:
    -  Mālik regarded the practices of Medina (the first three generations) to be a superior proof of the "living" sunnah than isolated, although sound, hadiths.
- The Zahiri school of thought recognizes three sources of the Islamic law within the principles of Islamic jurisprudence. The first is the Qur'an, considered by Muslims to be the verbatim word of God; the second consists of the prophetic as given in historically verifiable reports, which consist of the sayings and actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad; the last is absolute consensus of the Muslim community.

### Prominent shia schools

- Jaʿfari school: The time and space bound rulings of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school. It differs from the four schools or [madhhabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab) of Sunni [jurisprudence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh) in its reliance on [ijtihad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijtihad), as well as on matters of inheritance, religious taxes, commerce, personal status and the allowing of temporary marriage or[mutʿa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikah_mut%E2%80%98ah).
        - Zaidiyyah: In matters of Islamic jurisprudence, the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn ’Ali's teachings which are documented in his book Majmu’ al-Fiqh.
        - Abathi
    - "These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular hadiths they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason (qiyas) in deciding difficulties."

## Indian muslim demographics
- "Indian Muslims are 80-85% Sunni. Out of this, 75% Barelvi, 20% Deobandi. Barelvi (what are mostly called Sufis) and Deobandi are mostly, Hanafis (but can also include others like Shafi'i), while Wahhabi + Salafi are Hanbali. Barelvi (what are mostly called Sufis) and Deobandi are mostly, Hanafis (but can also include others like Shafi'i), while Wahhabi + Salafi are Hanbali. Wahhabis are less than 5% of Indian Muslim population. What you consider Wahhabi is actually Deobandi most of the times. The only group that can be counted as Wahhabi are Faraizi Bengali Sunnis."
- Indian Muslims are largely Hanafi except Kerala where most are Shafi'i.
- Deobandis spawned Tablighi Jama’at, Taliban.
- Barelvis have Dawat-i-islami.

- Islamists vs Jihadists
    - Islamists are in favor of establishing a muslim state and curb infiedels "eventually"; but they are not willing to start or participate in a revolution to accomplish it "right now". Jihadists, on the other hand, want to do it \*now\* and are willing to kill/ die for it.
        - Jihadi kid in kAshmIra [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgFPt1FqulE).
    - "Salafis are not jihadists, and most adhere to sects that reject the Islamic State. They are, as Haykel notes, committed to expanding Dar al-Islam, the land of Islam, even, perhaps, with the implementation of monstrous practices such as slavery and amputation—but at some future point. Their first priority is personal purification and religious observance, and they believe anything that thwarts those goals—such as causing war or unrest that would disrupt lives and prayer and scholarship—is forbidden." \[[ISIS_A](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
- Estimates of the percentage of people with radical beliefs in muslim population is at 15-25%, even if the fraction of people who work outside the system to act on them (by terrorizing others) is smaller.

## Other False hopes

- The [muta'zila movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27tazila), which tried to get to the position that the Quran is man-made and argued for rationality, was vanquished 10 centuries ago, and has not really resurged. Though, there are very small hopeful signs. 
    - Jihad Turk denies that the biographies of muhammad are reliable since they were written 200 years after his death, so he was not such a horrible person \[[Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oLjMaIR0-k)\]. But, his grounds are shaky elsewhere \[eg: [rebuttal](http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/exclusive-local-imam-misleads-interfaith-groups)\].
- Ahmadiyya-s are about as bad for pagans, despite their rejection by other muslims. Furqan Force ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furqan_Force)) fought India in 1949.

## Mutual recognition
- Odd day: Alevis are Rafidas+++(=refusers)+++. Even day: Alevis are Muslims
- In countries like Malaysia, Shias aren't even recognised.
- Ahmadiyyas are prohibited from calling themselves muslim in Pakistan.
