> Yuanshi records an interesting conversation between kulashekhara Pandya-I & the ambassador of Kubilai Khan. The pANDya states: "All Muslim states make full use of their countriesâ€™ natural products- gold, pearls and precious objects [and with] all their surpluses the Muslims come [here] to trade" This suggests that by 1280 CE the Mohd were using their wealth to get a grip on South Indian markets.

> The effect of this was profound on the trajectory of Hindudom. We know from the Khan's Ishvara temple in Mongol chIna that there were merchants from the tamiL country operating in Kubilai Khan's realm. But in the years that followed increasing use of their capital to dominate southern markets meant that the ghazis cut off the traditional H trade routes to the far east eventually leading to debacles of H lands of the Malay archipelago. It also limited the options of the Southern H kings when the jihad in the south began shortly there after.
