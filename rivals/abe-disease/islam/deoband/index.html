Mahmud Hasan, aka Shaykh al-Hind, founder of Deoband madrasa. Silk Letter Movement. Tried a jihAd against British to reestablish Muslim rule in India - Nipped in the bud. Highly aided by recent converts (including 2 brothers of Kriplani and a former sikh). Founding context Wars failed. Abdali, British, Sikh empire vs Syed Ahmed. Quite a few high-profile counter-conversions (including Arya samAj) had started. Response 1- small-scaling of jihAds. switched to riots. High profile assassinations. Response 2- ashrafs thought muslims haven’t adapted - so they’re loosing. Response 3- imAm mahdi claimants. Including Ahmediyas. Response 4- “muslim society is not prepared to focus on islamic state. Can we get to our goals without having a state? Can we make the society more properly islamic via grassroots efforts?” Response 4 led to founding of Deoband madrasa and later Tablighi jamAt. Many more madrasas were soon founded. Tablighi jamAt Established in 1926 by Muhammad Ilyas al-Kandhlawi was disciple of Mahmud Hasan. Also a disciple of Gangohi. A biography says that Muhammad Ilyas took a vow of (physical) jihAd in front of him.
