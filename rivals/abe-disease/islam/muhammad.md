## Ranking
> The Moslems count their Muhammad superior to all the prophets who have been sent by God, with the exception of Christ. But they hold that on Muhammadâ€™s advent, the Christian faith was killed or annihilated, just as Judaism was by the coming of Christ. The only title they give to Muhammad is the Messenger of God. - Pelsaert

## Gifts
> They attribute to him superhuman or fabulous gifts during his life on earth. For instance, a cloud or shadow always rested above his head; that his body cast no shadow; that flies never settled on it; that a long journey was shortened for him, and the road contracted; and that no one ever saw his excrement, which the earth opened and absorbed. - Pelsaert
