## Context
From divodAsa:

> It is to be noted that it was a Muslim who persuaded the Samuthiris to invade Valluvanad and annex the regions, thus turning the national festival of Kerala, Mamankam, into a bloody battlefield where hundreds and hundreds of Nair youths fought and perished. The Muslim leader who persuaded Samuthiris were given the title Calicut Koya and was appointed as bodyguard of Samuthiri, always taking position to his right side [2]. 
> 
> The Samuthiris also allowed the Muslims to settle down and preach their religion in his kingdom with total freedom. Apart from Calicut Koya, the naval force of Samuthiris was also headed by Muslim admirals who held hereditary title named Kunjali Marakkars. Kunjali Marakkars fought with the Portuguese along with other forces of Calicut.

## The betrayal of Kunjali Marakkars

> Thus the Samuthiris had close contacts with the Muslims during initial days of their independant rule after the fall of Chera Perumals around 12th century. But the scene changed in coming centuries.  After the defeat of Portuguese, the Kunjali Marakkar became arrogant and declared themselves as independent ruler of Malabar Muslims. They betrayed the Samuthiris who earlier had given him special privileges just like any other Nair Noble of his court.  He also challenged the authority of Samuthiris and attacked his subjects. He also claimed himself to be the King of Moplahs and as the lord of the Indian sea.

> French navigator François Pyrard de Laval writes in brief about the atrocities done by Marakkar [5]:
> 
> “This Cognialy was likewise one of the cruelest men in the world, and his great strength and power led him to despise his neighbours, even the king of Cananore, who had formerly been his protector and suzerain, and had aided him in all his projects. He harried in all directions, and all men’s goods. None could number the cruel barbarities practised by him and his against all sorts and conditions of men, without distinction : among others, against his own neighbour, the Nair king Auriole, already mentioned, whom he robbed and pillaged and drove from his kingdom : he cut off the nose and breasts of that prince’s queen, and had himself acknowledged as king. At length, puffed up with prosperity, he would no longer recognise the Samory, and rebelled against him, refusing to deliver up some vessels of his subjects that he had taken ; and when commanded so to do, he set all such commands at nought.”
> 
> In the end the Samuthiris had to make a treaty with the Portuguese and take down the last Kunjali Marakkar, thus putting an end to the arrogance of Marakkar and his Moplahs whom the Samuthiris considered as close allies before.
