      <description>&lt;p&gt;From divodAsa:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the fall of Marakkars, the Arakkal Ali Rajas of Kannur followed the same path. Ali Rajas of Arakkal were converts from a line of the Hindu Kolathiri Rajas of north Malabar. There are many folklore associated with them in North Malabar. They gained royal status via association with Kolathiris. But later they betrayed the Hindus of Malabar and began to claim superiority over Hindu kings by allying with Hyder Ali of Mysore [6]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From divodAsa:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is to be noted that it was a Muslim who persuaded the Samuthiris to invade Valluvanad and annex the regions, thus turning the national festival of Kerala, Mamankam, into a bloody battlefield where hundreds and hundreds of Nair youths fought and perished. The Muslim leader who persuaded Samuthiris were given the title Calicut Koya and was appointed as bodyguard of Samuthiri, always taking position to his right side [2].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Later, as history records, Tipu was defeated during his invasion of Travancore and was forced to retreat back to Mysore, where he eventually met his end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even after the fall of Tipu and British take over of Malabar,  many Moplahs remained as radical fanatics. They kept attacking Hindus and trying to convert them into islam. There were many such clashes between Hindus and Moplahs – always initiated by latter. These series of clashes finally lead to the 1921 genocide of Malabar Hindus, where thousands of Hindus were killed and several more were made to flee the region and numerous Hindu temples were destroyed by Moplah fanatics. It is a well recorded fact that the Hindus also retaliated against their attacks. Kalliat Nambiars for instance took out the Moplah fanatics who attacked their household [9]&lt;/p&gt;</description>
