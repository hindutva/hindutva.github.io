From divodAsa:

> The atrocities of Hyder and Tipu on Malabar Hindus is well recorded and it need not  be discussed in detail here as it is beyond the scope of the article. Later, as history records, Tipu was defeated during his invasion of Travancore and was forced to retreat back to Mysore, where he eventually met his end.
> 
> Even after the fall of Tipu and British take over of Malabar,  many Moplahs remained as radical fanatics. They kept attacking Hindus and trying to convert them into islam. There were many such clashes between Hindus and Moplahs – always initiated by latter. These series of clashes finally lead to the 1921 genocide of Malabar Hindus, where thousands of Hindus were killed and several more were made to flee the region and numerous Hindu temples were destroyed by Moplah fanatics. It is a well recorded fact that the Hindus also retaliated against their attacks. Kalliat Nambiars for instance took out the Moplah fanatics who attacked their household [9]
>
> It is to be noted that Eranad was one of the most affected regions during riots by the Moplah fanatics. Eranad in Malappuram was the ancestral home of Samuthiri’s Eradi Nair clan. The Samuthiris paid the ultimate price for settling down the Muslims in their kingdom.
