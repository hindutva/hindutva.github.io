From divodAsa:

> After the fall of Marakkars, the Arakkal Ali Rajas of Kannur followed the same path. Ali Rajas of Arakkal were converts from a line of the Hindu Kolathiri Rajas of north Malabar. There are many folklore associated with them in North Malabar. They gained royal status via association with Kolathiris. But later they betrayed the Hindus of Malabar and began to claim superiority over Hindu kings by allying with Hyder Ali of Mysore [6]
>
> “ Hyder was now visited by Ali Raja, a Mapelet, which is a nation that came originally from Arabia, and had spread over the whole coast of Malabar. These people had monopolised all the commerce of this country, and, by lending sums at exorbitant interest, had impoverished the Nayres, or native nobility. At this time, the Mapelets had grown rich and proud ; and Ali, their countryman, having by marriage been raised to the dignity of a prince, their insolence had greatly increased ; and, in order to obtain more consequence, they now solicited the protection of Hyder, which was readily granted, as they were of the same religion.”
>
> To put an end to the arrogance, the Samuthiris and his Nair forces confronted the Moplahs by killing thousands of them  and making even more flee from their lands.[7]
>
> “The Nayres, irritated by the arrogance and extortion of the Mapelets, conspired against them. and on an appointed day massacred above 6000 of these people. The rest fled in various directions.”
>
> But when Hyder and his son Tipu invaded Malabar, these Moplahs wholeheartedly joined their forces and attacked the Hindus and destroyed their countless temples. [8].
