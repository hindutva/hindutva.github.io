Muslim soldiers in Hindu armies - How does Islam view them? Amir Khusrow tells us in Khazainul Futuh -

During Malik Kafur's Malabar campaign a body of Mussalmans had allied themselves with a Hindu Raja and had violated the law of the Quran, 'Do not make the infidels your friends against the Mussalmans' (Quran 4:144) Seeing that the Hindu raja was being defeated, they changed sides and surrendered to Malik Kafur. Kafur had placed a V shaped yoke over their necks as a punishment. He asked them to recite the Kalima to testify their claim of being Mussalmans and later forgave them.

We are often boastfully told about overwhelming numbers of muslims in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's army. But in reality as per contemporary documents the number is negligible ( less than 2%) and most of them appear to be have employed for technical reasons.+++(4)+++ Kazi Haidar was a persian munshi who was hired by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for writing persian letters as the marathas were not used to write persian. Later a Hindu named Neel prabhu was Maharaj's persian munshi. This Kazi Haidar later defected to Aurangzeb and was instrumental in causing damages to Shivaji Maharaj's kingdom. Aurangzeb's court chronicles (Akhbars) give instances of how he was working to damage Shivaji Maharaj's kingdom. I will post a few Akhbars shortly.

Muslims who violate the quranic law and go against it are called 'Munafiq' and are sent to the lowest depths of hell fire. (Quran 4:145)
