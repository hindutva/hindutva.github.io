Amir Khusrow tells us in Khazainul Futuh -&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During Malik Kafur&amp;rsquo;s Malabar campaign a body of Mussalmans had allied themselves with a Hindu Raja and had violated the law of the Quran, &amp;lsquo;Do not make the infidels your friends against the Mussalmans&amp;rsquo; (Quran 4:144) Seeing that the Hindu raja was being defeated, they changed sides and surrendered to Malik Kafur. Kafur had placed a V shaped yoke over their necks as a punishment. He asked them to recite the Kalima to testify their claim of being Mussalmans and later forgave them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
