- As treacherous neighbors
    - During the 2014-15 attacks of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria on Yazidis and Christians:
        - "Worst killings came from our (Sunni) Muslim neighbors".. (Yazidi [report](http://news.yahoo.com/iraq-yazidis-neighbours-enabled-jihadist-attack-095139064.html), [Vid1](https://twitter.com/Thawra_city/status/871289293146267649), Christian confirmation: [memri1](http://www.memri.org/clip_transcript/en/4414.htm), [memri2](http://www.memri.org/clip/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4414.htm), ([MEF2015](http://www.meforum.org/5371/why-muslims-bad-neighbors))).
    - This was also observed during the partition of India (FB15).
