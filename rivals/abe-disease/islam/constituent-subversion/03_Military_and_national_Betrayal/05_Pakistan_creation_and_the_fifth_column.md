title = "05 Pakistan creation and the fifth column"

+++
- An overwhelming majority of muslims declared their unwillingness to live in a hindu majority democracy and ushered in the partition. Alas, a significant fraction of them stayed back anyway to form an inimical fifth column sympathetic to Pakistan.
  - In the 1946 provincial assembly elections, the Muslim League captured 4.5 million of about 6 million Muslim votes. So, 75% of Indian Muslims voted for the Muslim League and its demand for Pakistan. (One can probably even dig up district-wise statistics. I recall it was 90% of UP, Delhi.) But 75% of Indian muslims in various regions did not go to pAkistan despite voting for it. Though a small "elite" fraction of the adult population were eligible to vote - one can hardly say that this sample was not representative of the rest of the muslim population.
