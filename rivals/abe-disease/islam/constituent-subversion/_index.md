## Intro

Muslim society has a pernicious effect on non-muslim (especially polytheistic) societies. This is the cost of the short-term fitness-gain of the muslim pyramid scheme, as described in the [fitness-effect page](../fitness-effect/).

- Even when muslims are in the minority, the riot-manual injunctions of[sura At-Tawba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-Tawba)have been realized repeatedly.
    - Claims such as "there were no hindu-muslim riots before the British era", or "our temples were destroyed by armies and tyrants alone, none by ordinary rioters" are false. (Eg.[K](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/a-sayyid-kills-a-kashmirian-yogin/),)
    - Many of the "battles" quoted in early islamic history are actually best charactarized as riots, with 10-200 hooligans fighting pagans.
- The "victim narrative" is applied to generate anger and a pan-islamic response.
- Military betrayal (described below).
