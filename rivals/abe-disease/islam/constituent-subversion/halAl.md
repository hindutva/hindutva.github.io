## Geopolitical push
- A cartel of Islamic countries (led by pAkistAn and malaysia) insist on all imports (even non-meat food and non-food products like cement) having a halAl certificate.
- GoI FSSAI Green dot certifying absence of meat not respected by them - they insist on halAl certificate.

## Consequence
- "The most intolerant minority wins" rule of NN Taleb applies.
- halAl slaughter requires muslim butcher. So, companies are forced to hire muslims and exclude non-muslims.
  - For efficiency reasons, in the absence of sufficient pressure from non-muslims, it does not make sense for companies to hire two sets of workers for the same product.
- In the absence of strong non-muslim reaction, non-halAl meat is then not even available to customers who prefer that. For example, airlines prefer to stock and provide only halAl meat (caterer SkyChef supplies halAl meat only).
  - - Halal meat is cheaper, and most customers never bother complaining. Theoretically, halAl should be more expensive (peculiar requirement of a minority community). Amazing how the tables are turned due to the "intolerant minority" principle.
- To access 0.25x of the market, non-muslim companies are forced to go for halAl certificate - even when it makes no sense to do so (eg. non-meat products, Ayurvedic medicine). So, they are forced to pay local muslims for nothing.

## Reaction
- Insistence of reciprocity
  - If muslims refuse to eat meat butchered by Hindus ("won't be halAl"), why should Hindus eat meat butchered by Muslims? (Many non-muslims - including hindus and sikhs since many hundred years - insist on jhaTka meat.)
  - If muslims insist on part of the profits going to other muslims for useless certification (even on non-meat and non-food items) - should hindus not reciprocate in kind?
  - If GoI FSSAI Green dot certifying absence of meat is not respected by Islamic countries, why should non-muslim countries respect food certification of Islamic countries? 
- Government protection of non-muslim work-force and consumer choice
  - Insist that stores, trains and airlines carry jhaTka meat.
