Bilingual Inscription at Somnath
1264 AD, Arabic + Sanskrit ➡️ historic deception

Somnath fell and rose again many times, this is well known. Less known: Muslims thrived near Somnath between the destructions, asked for accommodation, sometimes deceptively. This 🧵 gives an example:

1. Nākhudā Nūruddin Fīrūz was a rich shipmaster from Hormuz. In the 13th century, he came with a plea to Chalukya-Vaghela king Arjunadeva. He spoke to leading Hindus. Asked for accommodation and permission. He bought land and shops in rebuilt Somnath-Patan (Veraval). Near the great temple.
2. Fīrūz built a mosque and left a bilingual inscription. Dated Ramaḍān AH 662 and Vikram Samvat 1320 – that is, 1264 AD. It records the treaty. It lists gifts for the upkeep of mosque. It names the witnesses. And... a deception.
3. The Sanskrit text (longer, 43 lines) speaks to Hindus. It opens with praise of Shiva – Vishwanatha, Sunyarupa, Visvarupa. It flatters the king. It notes the treaty in plain words. It mentions lamps, oil, water for the mosque. It shows courtesy. It respects the hosts.
4. The Arabic text (28 lines) speaks to Muslims. It begins with praise of Allah. It skips Shiva. It skips the Hindu king. It honors the Sultan of Hormuz. It explicitly says: “May Allah make this city of Somnath one of the cities of Islam. May He banish infidelity and idols.” It quotes: “Only he shall inhabit God’s places of worship who believes in Allah and the Last Day, performs prayer, pays zakat, and fears none but Allah alone.” And so on.
5. Same witnesses. Same gifts. Very different tone. Very different aims. Bilingual yes, but entirely different message, hopes and appeal. The bilingual slabs stood together for centuries. Later they were split. One went to a Hindu temple. One to another mosque.
6. Marxist scholars and apologists explain this away as a "political" need. Muslims were few then. They couldn't say their true desire, they had to adapt.
7. Others see the five deception doctrines at work, doctrines born in the Middle East, 8th–13th centuries: Taqiyya, Kitman, Tawriya, Mudara, K'hida.
