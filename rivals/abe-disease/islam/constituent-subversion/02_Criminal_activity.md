- "The findings: about 80% of the criminals at the petty-crime level were Muslims, that figure decreasing when it came to white-collar crime. Please note that under the Indian Penal Code, petty crime includes armed robbery, dacoity and attempted murder - all of which carry heinous penalties by Shariat, which was the point in discussion." \[[RED](http://www.rediff.com/news/sep/05varsha.htm) 2005 varShA\]


## Kerala records
Via divodAsa:

> Apart from recorded history, the local folklore of Kerala also narrates about Moplah troublemakers. The local legends recorded in Aithihyamala, a popular collection of legends by Kottarathil Shankunni also narrates how the Muslims were troublemakers in the kingdom of Cochin [10]. It narrates the story of Kochi king Rama Varma Shaktan Thampuran on how he executed a Moplah who slaughtered a cow in the kingdom. Another story from same work narrates how Shaktan Thampuran executed a Moplah who tried to sexually assault a Nambuthiri Brahmin lady while her husband was away [11] and also talks about punishment given by Shaktan Thampuran to Moplah thieves who pillaged the travellers [12].

> There are also other records of Moplah troublemakers. For instance one of Vadakkan Pattu or ballads of North Malabar records that famous heroine Unniyarcha confronted the Moplahs who tried to assault her [13]. Another ballad also records famous warrior Thacholi Othenan battling Moplahs who disrespected the Kolathiri king of north Malabar [14].
