- Mahmud Hasan, aka Shaykh al-Hind, founder of Deoband madrasa. Silk Letter Movement. Tried a jihAd against British to reestablish Muslim rule in India - Nipped in the bud. Highly aided by recent converts (including 2 brothers of Kriplani and a former sikh).

## Founding context
- Wars failed. Abdali, British, Sikh empire vs Syed Ahmed.
- Quite a few high-profile counter-conversions (including Arya samAj) had started.
- Response 1- small-scaling of jihAds. switched to riots. High profile assassinations.
- Response 2- ashrafs thought muslims haven't adapted - so they're loosing.
- Response 3- imAm mahdi claimants. Including Ahmediyas.
- Response 4- "muslim society is not prepared to focus on islamic state. Can we get to our goals without having a state? Can we make the society more properly islamic via grassroots efforts?" 
- Response 4 led to founding of Deoband madrasa and later Tablighi jamAt.
- Many more madrasas were soon founded.


## Tablighi jamAt
- Established in 1926 by Muhammad Ilyas al-Kandhlawi was disciple of Mahmud Hasan. Also a disciple of Gangohi. A biography says that Muhammad Ilyas took a vow of (physical) jihAd in front of him.
- Muhammad Ilyas's maternal grandfather, Muzaffar hussain, was disciple of muhammad ishaq, principle disciple of shAh waliullah's son. Another ancestor was also direct disciple of abdul aziz, and after his death, syed ahmed barelvi.
- Notable people - shAh waliullah, muinuddin khan, aliuddin mian, zAkir naik

### Modus operandi
- Go to some place in a group.
- Knock on doors.
- Live in a mosque.
- Deliver an inspirational speech aka bayaan. Give some simple instruction.
- Invite volunteers to do the same. Eg. Devote 3 days. 
- Take them to huge confereces at markaz-es. So, disconnect from local practices and identification. Connect to global ummah.
