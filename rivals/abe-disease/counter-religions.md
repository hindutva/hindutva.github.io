Counter religions like Abe's diseases, buddhuism etc.. emerge and copy-paste heavily from their prior natural religions (called the "borrow and curse" dynamic). That does not make them the same or equally benign etc.. - Just as a cancer cell is mostly a copy of a healthy cell; but is sufficiently different as to proliferate and kill out all healthy cells; ultimately rendering the host crippled or dead.
