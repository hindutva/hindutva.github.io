- Jews very deliberately study and strategize for their survival.
- Eg. UK-demography [study](http://www.jpr.org.uk/publications/tag.demography).
- Considering to the rise of India and China [IS](http://isteve.blogspot.ca/2010/07/china-v-india-which-will-be-good-for.html).
- Dr. Shalom Wald \[[bookz](http://bookzz.org/book/2493368/cfbd55)\], who "chose 14 well-known historians, from Thucydides to Gibbon, Spangler, Toynbee and Kennedy, and examined their theories concerning the circumstances in which civilizations flourish or collapse. Then he tried to examine how these theories can be applied to the context of the Jewish people." One major recommendation was that Jews do not concentrate entirely in Israel - it is not the best survival strategy.
