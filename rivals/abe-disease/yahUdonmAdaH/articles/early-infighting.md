An often overlooked fact is that Greek and Roman rule saved many Jews from being persecuted  by other Jews. The Maccabean dynastic period was one round of persecutions and forced conversions by Jews on Jews after another. The Romans got involved there because of Jewish infighting. 

King Jannaeus had Pharisees crucified by the hundreds because he supported a different type of Judaism.  
Samaritans were persecuted by other Jews and had their temple destroyed.  
Idumaeans were forced to become Jews at sword point.  
There was a temple in Egypt founded by Jews and a branch of the priestly dynasty who were run out of the Jerusalem temple, yet more infighting over religion. The high priest claimant Onias was assassinated by other Jews near or at the Grove of Daphne while under Greek protection.  

In fact the Jews spent their period of independence tearing eachother apart over Torah interpretation and anything else. During the 68 Jewish revolt against Rome the rebels killed many jews simply for not being of their particular sect. When the Romans sieged Jersualem the Jews were fightng each other within the city, different sects had a falling out.

Various Jewish sectarian texts(dead sea scrolls, Damascus document, early Christians, apocrypha) is full of hate toward other Jews. Book of Enoch introduces hell as a torture chamber manned by angels for other jews who don't believe that sect, including the children of other Jews.
