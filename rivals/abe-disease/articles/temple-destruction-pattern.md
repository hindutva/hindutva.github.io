Muslims and Christians deliberately chose pagan sites to assert the supremacy of their religion over paganism. 

- The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built atop a Temple of Venus built by Hadrian.
  - Nor is there any evidence that the Temple of Venus was venerated by Christians as the site of Golgotha prior to Helena's "vision."
- The Kaaba in Mecca was a pagan shrine with 360 idols.
  - There is no historical evidence that Abraham or Ishmael even existed, let alone that they built the Kaaba in Mecca.
- Likewise, the Mexico City Cathedral was built with the stones of the Aztec Templo Mayor.


In other words, two of the holiest sites of Christianity and Islam are rooted in predatory usurpation of pagan sites that was retroactively justified on pseudo-historical grounds.
