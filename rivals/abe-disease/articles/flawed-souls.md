## Taintably perfect?
The obvious but profound implication of this point is that the soteriological end-state claimed by Christianity is intrinsically flawed because it assumes that a perfect soul can be tainted from the without. 

To state that the Devil made Adam commit the original sin (and that Christian salvation works because the Devil will be consigned to hell for eternity) is no answer because there must be something intrinsic in Adam’s constitution that allowed him to heed the words of the devil. 

## Islam
Islam does not uphold the Christian doctrine of original sin but subscribes to the idea that humans were created with free will so that they can freely worship allah. However, all Abrahamic notions of free will clearly suggest a will that can be ultimately fettered by ignorance, greed, pride or some other vice or limitation. In this sense, it is not truly free will either. In any case, the same fault of deliberately creating fallible creatures attaches to allah.
 
Abrahamic explanations for evil ultimately prove to be dissatisfying—without exception.

## Śaiva-Siddhānta contrast
In the Śaiva-Siddhānta, the relationship between a soul and one of the infinite individual-specific powers of Mala (the primordial impurity that is the supporting root of all other insentient bondages such as karma and the māyā-derived body, etc) is deemed to be beginningless (but not innate to the soul) because if a pure soul (free of mala’s hold) could succumb to one of the Śaktis of Mala with a beginning in time, there can be no eternal state of salvation.

For Christians who do not believe in eternal souls, the only realistic option is that their “God” created souls with this intrinsic defect (mala or whatever else you want to call it) and that clearly leads to an evil “God” who cannot be trusted. 

It is obvious that non-Abrahamic religions came up with far more satisfying answers to the problem of sin/evil. A Hindu anti-missionary monk (Chattampi Svāmī) argued that the Biblical god was a “Paśu” (literally beast—technical Śaiva term for bound soul) bound by ignorance & passions like most of us here; albeit with greater powers which got to his head, leading him to a self-delusion that he is the creator.
