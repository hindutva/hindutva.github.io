Not a single primary source from Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Egyptian, Hittite, Hurrian, Mittani, Canaanite or ANY LANGUAGE at all mentions an Abraham from Ur that travelled to Egypt and met with a pharaoh and then fought wars against kings in Syria & the Levant (which should be easy to find).

Outside of the Bibile, not even Hebrew, Greek or Aramaic texts mention Abraham until Hecataeus of Abdera around 310BCE. And even those fragments from Hecataeus are lost and only come down to us in citations from Josephus and Diodorus. 

Also nothing in the archaeological record has ever even come close to verifying Abraham's existence, or those wars he fought in, or him meeting with the pharaoh. Nothing of the sort. We only found the city of Ur. Which was a well known city that some very minimalist scholars did doubt existed until it was finally discovered. But we also found the city of Troy and that tells us nothing about Achilles. Nothing in the city of Ur that was dug tells us anything about Abraham. 

Abraham means "father of nations". 

A clear sign of a fable is when the character in the story has a name that describes his role in the story. Nobody just names their kids "FatherOfNations" and then it just happens to end up being the main patriarch and grandfather of the entire race of people that the book is based on. 

Anyone being honest with themselves can tell that Abraham never existed and CC is gaslighting himself.
