Illuminating Bible passages on how a pagan deserves only deceit, dissimulation and to be taken advantage of - even when he extends help. Even if fellow-Abrahamics are mortal enemies, a Pagan who extends shelter to one never really wins their loyalty or trust.

## David and Saul
The scene: David flees Israelite territory. King Saul is trying to kill him, no matter how much David tries to prove his bona fides. David + 600 soldiers (w/ families) take shelter with Philistine King Achish of Gath - pagans the Israelites hate. (https://t.co/fGyP041ahB) Pagan king Achish grants David a town to settle in, hoping to win favour through hospitality. And perhaps driving a wedge in Israel. Instead, behind his host's back, David and his men sack and massacre nearby pagan settlements - making sure that the king doesn't hear of it.

Next is war between Israelites & Philistines. David & company accompany Achish en route to battle. Achish's generals voice doubts over David's loyalty. Naive Achish still trusts. David pretends innocence. Asks if Achish has any evidence of betrayal. (https://t.co/nqADUMGrjX) On generals' insistence, David is sent back. He attacks other Philistine clans while Achish fights Israelites. Achish wins war. Israelite king Saul (who had persecuted David) commits suicide. But David laments Saul's death. The generals were right. (https://t.co/dws5TM0qmC)

Later, David assumes Israelite kingship. He does not repay the political sanctuary he was given as a refugee. Does not make peace with Philistines & become a good neighbor. Instead, David consolidates & makes war on Philistines to prove worthiness. (https://t.co/BJHgvG0TX3)

## Echoes elsewhere
Note how Rohingya refugees in India immediately bombed the holiest Buddhist sites in Bihar. They aided Kashmiri jihadi attacks on Indian security forces in Jammu. This comes from the same mentality outlined above. 

Hindu kingdoms gave refuge to persecuted early Christians from Syria, who settled in Kerala. They were even exempt from paying local taxes. But when Portuguese Christians established a foothold in India, local Syrian Christians became active collaborators. Same mentality.

We will see the same theme play out in post-Christian Europe that has been inundated by waves of immigrants and refugees from heavily indoctrinated Abrahamic lands.

## Conclusion
Understanding this mindset also impacts vetting & cultural assimilation for recruitment into security & admin apparatus. We see fruits of special drives to recruit Indian Muslims into services - repeated instances of religious bias & zealotry. Sometimes complete treason. If Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, "post-Christian" Western liberals, neo-pagans & others can understand this Abrahamic mentality, then proper vetting, probation, supervision & assimilation of refugees coming from Abrahamic cultures can be built into national policy.
