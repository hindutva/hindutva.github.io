## Disdain for "failure" hindu
- Sikhism has latent abrahamist tendencies. In a way, it is proto-islamophile-secularism. Same with many baba-isms. See [anti-hindu patterns page](../Anti-hindu_patterns/) for details.

## mIri-pIri  
- It aimed to rearm hindus (spiritually and materially) during oppressive Mughal muslim times by emphasizing (even by "democratizing") kShatra. In a sense, they revived the Steppe warrior ethos - albeit in a limited sense (lacking in sophistication, and with many unArya tendencies).

## Virtual kin marker temorarily increasing group fitness
> In this context one could also bring up the case of the pA~nchanada-uShnIShamoha. This moha emerged as result of part but not whole of the khilimoha infecting the Hindu population of the pa~nchanada. The result was the emergence of a new recombinant memetic virus, the uShnIShamoha that retained the self-propagating tendencies of the original khilimoha. This infection was very mild in terms of fitness reduction, but provided a strong virtual kin marker that allowed the infected group to prevail and spread at the expense of the Hindus of the pa~nchanada, and also offered protection to the infected against being overrun by the spreading khilimoha. But as its numbers increased its utility as such a virtual kin marker diminished. Nevertheless, it continues to serve this purpose to a degree in new areas colonized by its carriers, such as North America.

## Regression in brAhma
- Even as they progressed on kShatra, they regressed in brAhma prowess.
- The general phenomenon of all varNas taking to arms in times of distress was over-emphasized, leading to the absence of a purely ritualist-scholarly-conservative brAhmaNa class; which was a major successful innovation in Indo Iranian and related pagan streams. This was slightly mitigated by orders such as udAsi-s before AkAli dominance.
- Due to anti-hindu tendencies, despite half-hearted borrowing and adaptation, they were unable to take full benefit of strong and vibrant prior hindu tradition (esp vedas, vedAngas including nyAya and mImAMsA, Agams, tantras).
- This regression impeded their analysis, understanding and expression of concepts they themselves strongly accepted and rejected, such as:
  - Natural social structure
  - The spiritual warrior (Eg. distinction between rAjadharma and general xAtra)
  - Theurgy and Rituals
  - The Gods

## British subversion
- Kahn Singh Nabha + macauliffe.
