The biggest propaganda is that Sikhism gained popularity because of Hinduism's archaic principles, particularly Varnashram. All Sikh Gurus came from one caste - Khatri and largely their children also married within their own community. If it was so egalitarian then why this? 

## Caste strictures
SCs were barred from Golden Temple. The Mazhabis (SC) were forbidden to enter the Golden Temple for worship; their offering of karah prasad was not accepted and the Sikhs denied them access to public wells and other utilities. Khalsa Dharam Sastrar of 1914 laid down that the members of the untouchable groups (like the Mazhabi, Rahtia and Ramdasia Sikhs) did not have the right to go beyond the fourth step in the Golden Temple. The members of the fourfold varnas including Nai, Chippe, Jhivar, were instructed not to mix with persons belonging to the untouchable castes. Those who were guilty of breaking caste rules were classified as 'patit' and shunned by the Sikh civil society.

## Ambedkar's plan
Ambedkar in 1936 seriously considered en masse conversion of the ‘Depressed Classes’ to Sikhism with a view to liberate them from the shackles of ‘manuvadi’ caste system. But why didn't he do it? Because it has the same structure which Hinduism had. Ambedkar had decided by June 1936 to embrace Sikhism along with his followers. This had the approval of the leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha and of Shankracharya Kurtakoti. After participating in the Sikh Missionary conference at Amritsar in April Ambedkar sent his son, Yashwant Rao, and nephew to the Golden Temple in May, where they stayed for one month and a half, to observe the situation and meet with leaders of the community.

Ambedkar indefinitely postponed the idea of conversions to Sikhism which is primarily related to his anxiety about the fate of the Depressed Classes’ share in political power after conversion. The untouchables of Punjab had conveyed to Ambedkar the atrocities they suffered at the hands of the dominant community of jat Sikhs and appealed to him to ensure that the untouchables never become Sikhs.

### Apprehension of Jat Sikh Political class

Sardar Kapur Singh in his controversial book, Saachi Sakhi has said that after six crore (60 million) untouchables became Sikhs, the Jat Sikhs would be marginalised. No Jat Sikh leaders like Baldev Singh would be nominated to the viceroy executive council as a representative of the Sikh community. Hence, they were cold about Ambedkar accepting Sikhism. He stated that, because of this and the differences between Akali leaders and Ambedkar, the six crore untouchables publicly dropped the idea of adopting Sikh religion. But even the failure of incorporating a massive community didn't change the Jat Sikhs attitude.

They famously said - "By making six crore of untouchables, Sikhs, should we hand over the Darbar Sahib to Chuhars”?

## Reason for Sikhs success in Punjab

Long Muslim rule and annexation of Punjab (Pakistan Punjab) had forced Vedic Brahmins to migrate towards Indo Gangetic valley. This gave free reign to Baba culture who were not challenged by the Brahmins unlike in other parts of the country.+++(4)+++

### Ranjit Singh and rise of Organised group

The Sikhs numbers increased after the rise of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Prior to that it was a ragtag group full of marauders and hippies who had their own ideas of God. Shuffling between Kabir to Baba Farid. After the execution of Guru Arjan by Mughal King Jahangir, the Sikhs were able to expand beyond Khatris. But interestingly very few Harijans even after the bloody execution.

## Sikhism changed to Jattism

The British conducted the 1881 Census, which took stock of the caste variable. At that time it was found that among 1,706,909 persons who returned themselves as Sikh, about 63 per cent were jats. And for the rest, it was largely Khatris. So much for Martial Sikh Quam!

The Sikhs were recognised as one of the most prominent martial races of India for their loyal support in suppressing the rebellion. During the 1857 rebellion, Sikhs constituted 28% of the army in Punjab. The British administrators in Punjab understood that those who stood firmly loyal and served breakwaters of the storm needed to be rewarded. Hence Martial Qaum status. Loyal to Gora Master!
