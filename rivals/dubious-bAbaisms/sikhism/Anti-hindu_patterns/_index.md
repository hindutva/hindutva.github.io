Many sardaars show traits typical of secularists - on the surface turned their backs on mosaic religion, while retaining the same disdain for heathens and their practices. This likely has its roots in the perceived failure and abject subservient state of hindus during mogol times in the panchanada area. 

Some disturbing patterns include:

- Equating hinduism with inimical abrahamisms
- Image worship (and many other hindu activities) are considered "superstition" - the video fits right in. (This should remind you of the anti-superstition = anti-hindu legislation of our sickular overlords). This often degenerates to active iconoclasm or tolerance of iconoclasm.
- Mocking of hindu rituals (upanayana, tarpaNa by guru NAnak, durgA pUjA by some later guru according to some accounts).
