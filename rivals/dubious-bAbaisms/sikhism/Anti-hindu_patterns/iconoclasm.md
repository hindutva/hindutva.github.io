## naina devI incident

"The story makes clear that the Guru didn't approve of this case of vandalism over-interpreted as iconoclasm. The mockery of the goddess's idol can be applied to any religious object, e.g. the Guru Granth. Set it on fire & it won't defend itself, nor will it rat on you. Lifeless." - KE

> In short, after the battle of Kartarpur he went to Phagwāra. From there, since it was difficult for him to stay in any place near Lahore, he proceeded to Karaitpur (Kiratpur) which is situated within the Punjāb hills. That area belonged to Rāja Tärächand, who did not pursue the path of allegiance and obedience to King Shāhjahān. The people of that area worshipped images. On the top of the mountain an image of a goddess, known as Naina Devi has been set up. Rājas and others from the territories around, going to that place, followed the custom of making a pilgrimage [to it). When the Guru settled himself there, a Sikh of his, Bhairū by name, going to the temple, broke the nose of the goddess. The Rājas got the news of it and complained to the Guru, taking his [Bhairu's] name. The Gurū summoned Bhairū. Bhairu denied it. The Rājas' servants said, “We recongnise this (man)." He replied, "O Rājas, ask the goddess. If she takes my name, you can kill me." The Rājas said, "Fool, how can the goddess speak?" Bhairū broke into laughter, saying, “One now knows who is the fool. When she cannot prohibit anyone from breaking her own head, and cannot identify the person who has attacked her, what good do you expect from her, and why do you worship her?” The Rājas were put to silence.
