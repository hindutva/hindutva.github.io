## durgiAna amRtsar
Durgiana Mandir is one of the oldest temples of Amritsar. According to the regional Hindu tradition, the temple was built on the spot where Lava and Kusha bound Hanuman. The temple annually attracts millions of Hindus from all over the country. Amristsar has a very ancient Hindu history. According to the regional Hindu tradition recorded in the "Survey of Amritsar", Amritsar got its name from Amrit immersed by Lava and Kusha in a pond.

Durgiana Mandir was rebuilt in 1921. It was used to house the Murtis of Vishnu and Durga which were thrown out from the Parikrama of Harmandir Sahib in 1905.

Because of its presence in Amritsar, it became a frequent target of radicals during the Khalistan movement. In 1982, in what was a completely unprovoked attack, the Dal Khalsa "activists" threw a severed cow head inside Durgiana temple.

## mahAkAlI paTiyAlA
Mahakali temple of Patiala is a very famous temple. It was built by Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Murti of Kali was brought from Bengal. In 1982, Khalistani radicals hung tail of a cow inside the Mahakali temple of Patiala. Devotees were shocked to see the tail of a cow hung inside the Garba Griha of the temple. Dal Khalsa, an organization which claims that it strives to establish an independent Khalsa state, not only took responsibility for these attacks but also declared their intention of repeating them.

## rAm-tIrat
Ram Tirath is one of the oldest temples of Amritsar. According to the Hindu tradition, Ram Tirath was the place where Goddess Sita gave birth to Lava and Kusha. On December 3 1983, Khalistani activists sprinkled petrol on the Murtis of Krishna, Subhadra and Balrama inside the Garba Girha of Ram Tirath temple and set the Murtis on fire. 

## Panchmukhi Hanuman
