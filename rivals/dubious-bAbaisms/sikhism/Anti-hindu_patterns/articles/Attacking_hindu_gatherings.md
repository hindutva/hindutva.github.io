- Radicals desecrated Ram Lila. May 31 1988
- They bombed Hindu fairs like Shivaratri & Ramnavami where Hindus gathered in large numbers to ensure maximum Hindu kiIIings.

## TV series
In 1980s and 1990s, not everybody in Punjab had television sets. People used to gather outside shops to watch the serial Mahabharata based on the great Hindu epic. The radicals were especially jealous of TV serials Ramayana and Mahabharata as they rejuvenated public interest in Hindu epics. The Khalistani radicals used to bomb. Another day, another set of people watching the TV serial Mahabharata was bombed by Khalistani radicals. 5 kiIIed.

Like Mahabharata, the great epic Ramayana was also the target of these radicals. 1988: People watching Ramayana in public were bombed by Khalistan radicals. Mind you, the attack took place in Hindu majority Kurukshetra (Haryana) and not Punjab. Bombs are new weapon in Punjab terrorists' arsenal.
