      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 1984 Jain temple in Amritsar was looted and desecrated. Because the Jains are a very affluent community, Jain temples were seen by radicals as a great source for loot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On February 28 of the same year, another Jain temple was looted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brahmins were a favorite target of Khalistani activists. Bhindranwale&amp;rsquo;s rhetoric frequently centred on anti Brahmanism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On 25th June 1983, a Pujari of a temple in Sultanpur was kiIIed with a sharp knife. While attacks on Hindu places of worship have abated in Punjab, thanks to the anti militancy drives of police and army, they are not completely a thing of past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a Hindu priest was warned and shot.  He passed away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: TI on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Radicals desecrated Ram Lila. May 31 1988&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They bombed Hindu fairs like Shivaratri &amp;amp; Ramnavami where Hindus gathered in large numbers to ensure maximum Hindu kiIIings.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tv-series&#34;&gt;TV series&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1980s and 1990s, not everybody in Punjab had television sets. People used to gather outside shops to watch the serial Mahabharata based on the great Hindu epic. The radicals were especially jealous of TV serials Ramayana and Mahabharata as they rejuvenated public interest in Hindu epics. The Khalistani radicals used to bomb. Another day, another set of people watching the TV serial Mahabharata was bombed by Khalistani radicals. 5 kiIIed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Carl&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Angry schismatic monotheisms tend to be oedipal wrt parent religion &amp;amp; sibling rivalry among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;modus-operandi&#34;&gt;Modus operandi&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Capturing political power, strategic economic sectors &amp;amp; a part of the underworld in CAN in record time is unprecedented. Low IQ is a false stereotype. Rash sometimes, yes. But not stupid. And very organized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;negative-potential&#34;&gt;Negative potential&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Khali case will lead to split within Sikhi itself since it is a very artificial construct. Khali version will thrive &amp;amp; dominate diaspora at least for foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
