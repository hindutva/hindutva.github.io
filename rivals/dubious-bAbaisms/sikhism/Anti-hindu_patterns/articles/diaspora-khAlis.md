Angry schismatic monotheisms tend to be oedipal wrt parent religion & sibling rivalry among themselves.


## Modus operandi
Capturing political power, strategic economic sectors & a part of the underworld in CAN in record time is unprecedented. Low IQ is a false stereotype. Rash sometimes, yes. But not stupid. And very organized.

## Negative potential
Khali case will lead to split within Sikhi itself since it is a very artificial construct. Khali version will thrive & dominate diaspora at least for foreseeable future.

## Positive Potential
Majority can be reintegrated for +ve role westward when the time comes. साम is prereq for भेदनं. The situation in diaspora is also more complex actually & not all militants are ideologically diff from Hs. Some are uber-H.
