- Academic arrogance and rigid unwillingness to change wrong opinions.

## The nature of the "social sciences" academic establishment
- "They also know that holding (or at least uttering) the required opinions can make or break an academic career: either formally, as when a non-Anglican could not get admission to Oxford University, or informally, as under the reign of progressivist conformism today. To think highly of the academic world presupposes a link between scientific achievement and academic rank, and this largely makes sense in the exact sciences. In the humanities, especially in the social “science” and literature departments, this link is also deduced, but only as a parasitical extension of the conventions in the exact sciences. Much of what passes for scholarship these days is only ideology wrapped into jargon." \[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]
