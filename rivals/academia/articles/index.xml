      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Duty in India&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Churchill Parliament Square&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Winston Churchill, Parliament Square, London&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;March 18, 1931. Albert Hall, London&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this moment of crisis for Baldwin, a by-election was taking place in St. George’s, Westminster. At one point Baldwin considered resigning his seat and standing as a candidate, but in the event the pro-Baldwin banner was carried by Duff Cooper against an anti-Baldwin candidate vigorously supported by Beaverbrook and Rothermere. The impact of this meeting at the Albert Hall just outside the constituency was overshadowed by Baldwin’s attack the same evening on the “Press Lords,” whom he condemned as seeking “power without responsibility the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages”. The phrase came from Baldwin’s cousin, Rudyard Kipling. It was devastating. Duff Cooper won easily and Baldwin’s leadership was preserved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THREAD: Did you know that a student filed a complaint against Hindu professors at @dartmouth just bc they were Hindu?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Didn’t hear about it? Our team investigated the biggest Hinduphobic scandal in Dartmouth’s history. First and foremost, while we recognize that the details of the case are sensitive and centered around sexual harassment, this will not be the focus of the thread. So, what happened?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maha Hasan Alshawi was a graduate student at Dartmouth College. In February 2020, Alshawi met with Dartmouth’s Deputy Title IX Coordinator Gary Sund and Title IX Coordinator Kristi Clemens to report an alleged incident of sexual harassment.&#xA;She had reported that her research advisor, Professor Li, “touched his private area inappropriately” for 20 to 30 seconds. The professor denied the allegations and maintained that at the time of the alleged incident he was in Macau, China and Washington, D.C. for conferences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hindutva smokescreen</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-hinduism&#34;&gt;Defining Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Defining Hinduism, the Sanatana Dharma, in modern times has been fraught with challenges. They arise from the fact that the Indic notion of “religion” is different from the Western-Abrahamic one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hinduism does not fit the typical “religion” parameters as understood by most of the modern world. For example, Hindu Dharma is non-dogmatic. According to S. N. Balagangadhara (Balu), one of the problems of defining Hinduism is that there is no Indic notion of “religion.” When “outsiders” came into contact with India, they tried to make sense of Indic religions, including Hinduism, from their lenses. From Albiruni to Wendy Doniger, they have attempted to define Hinduism from their religious and ideological prisms and prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian Historiography</title>

My heartfelt thanks goes out to them for organising the event and for being such gracious hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AT THE OUTSET, I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to the oganisers of the Pondicherry Literature Festival for inviting me. My additional gratitude is also due to them for two profound reasons. The first is the choice of the venue…this is the city sanctified by Sri Aurobindo’s lifelong penance and his brilliant vision that continues to reveal itself in multiple realms…of spirituality, nationalism, freedom, Bharatiyata, and history. The second reason is the thoughtfulness and timeliness on the part of the organisers in the choice of topic: Indian historiography at 75. Indeed, it is highly befitting that we should be discussing this on the occasion of Azadi ka Amritmahtosav… 75 years of celebrating India’s freedom from foreign rule.&#xA;Historians: Then and Now&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://krishenkak.wordpress.com/2004/06/25/the-white-solution-to-brown-problems-june-25-2004/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;68&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The White solution to Brown problems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one starts on a personal experience, but I hope it has a larger lesson that is topical. Not so very long ago, I negotiated a Ph.D. from Princeton University. Shri Ashok Chowgule has for some time been pressing me to share that experience with the larger world, and “prevailing ideology” in David Brooks, “Lonely Campus Voices”, The New York Times, Sept 27, 2003 that Shri Chowgule circulated, plus certain behaviour, essentially unchanged since it was televised to the world on May 18, 2004, prompts me now to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reaction to Truschke</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On reactions to Audrey Truschke&amp;rsquo;s rants It&amp;rsquo;s disappointing most counters come from H-Right. Her fellow indologists of repute don&amp;rsquo;t take her on, which reduces H-trust in them E.g. Edwin Bryant works in the same university as Audrey. You don&amp;rsquo;t see him taking her on Indologists often complain about how H-side is too much into conspiracy theories, and disrespectful of academia, mainstream scholarship etc But you don&amp;rsquo;t help matters with your selective outrage and silence H&amp;rsquo;s loss of faith in the system is understandable. It is v evident there is tribalism at work and maybe even a covert form of racism - Where nonsense that is critical of Hindus is tolerated and even tacitly encouraged by those who ought to know better, While nonsense that emanates from Hindus is picked on with alacrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, despite its lofty goal of resisting colonial domination, it was fundamentally constrained politically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Harvard Professor Michael Witzel a Hindu-Hater?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;A CASE STUDY IN ACADEMIC HINDUPHOBIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rev B (31 March 2009)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By Vishal Agarwal and others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I always get misrepresented that I am a Hindu-hater, but I am not.”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Michael Witzel in &lt;em&gt;India Abroad&lt;/em&gt;, issue dated 16 December 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;00&#34;&gt;00&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This case study, modeled after Harvard Business School case studies, is a compilation done by several concerned netizens opposed to racism, for the purpose of discussion only. All attempts have been made to check the original sources. The compilers are not responsible for the opinions and statements of Dr Witzel stated in this study. We acknowledge the immensely useful material cut and paste (with slight modification) from several public websites. We hope the authors of these websites will not object, and that the discussants of this case study will verify the veracity of our citations directly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
