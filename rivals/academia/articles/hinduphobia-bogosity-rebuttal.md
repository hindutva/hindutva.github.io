## Large scale casualities claim
First -- 

> "Anti-Hindu bias, [unlike Islamophobia and anti-Semitism], *cannot be easily linked* to casualties on such horrific scales."  
> Source: 'Hindutva Harrassment Field Manual,' South Asia Scholar Activist Collective (SASAC).

Second --

> "Nothing is more clear, or *more easily documented*, than the systematic campaign of terror – and its genocidal consequences – launched by the Pakistani army on the night of March 25th... Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered and, in some places, painted with yellow patches marked ‘H.' America’s heavy support of Islamabad is nothing short of complicity."  
>Source: Ted Kennedy, U.S. Senate Judiciary Comte. "Crisis in South Asia."

To repeat the contrast for emphasis,

> First -- "cannot be easily linked to casualties on horrific scales." (SASAC, 2021)

> Second -- "Nothing is more clear, or more easily documented... campaign of terror... genocidal consequences... Hindu community." (Sen. Kennedy, 1971)

## Long-time usage of 'Hinduphobia'
The first source also claims 'Hinduphobia' coined by right-wing people recently in order to make "bad faith bias claims."

In reality, academics have created working definition of "Hinduphobia," and the word itself has been used as suggested by the definition since at least 1883.

PS - Here is link to the definition again: https://understandinghinduphobia.org which was developed by -@indumathi37, @aravindasharma, @RaniRosser, @hinduprof, and I

## Conclusion
I'd expect fellow scholars to act in good faith and present counter-arguments fairly, not redact the existence of these in academia and paint a "straw man" of 'Hinduphobia' as terminological product of "extremists." At least, I am used to such basic good faith in economics. In any case, whitewashing the anti-religious origins of violence with "genocidal consequences" is just cause to call anyone out publicly, on any day of the week. The politeness desirable in scholarly disagreements must sometimes bend for these egregious exceptions.
