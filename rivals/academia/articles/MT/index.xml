      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/29/the-mlechcha-subversionists/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have never been a great fan of many modern Hindu fads:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They include the foolish opposition to the ultimate non-Indian origin of the Indo-Aryan and their incursion into India.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The statement that all religions say the same thing only their practioners distort the “Truth”. This is especially frightening ignorance with respect to Islam and Christism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Hindus in reality worship only one god.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hindus do not believe in the evolutionary theory.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I have always held that it is up to Hindus themselves to chose their desired level of ignorance rather than be “saved” by some blathering Indologist. As I have argued before, Indologists are not all bad, their translations of the veda have given uneducated Hindus the chance to understand them at some superficial level. Without these aids, the lack of proper Sanskrit education in India may have kept the masses even more ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Max Mueller: good, bad or a Malhotran U-turner?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/04/12/max-mueller-good-bad-or-a-malhotran-u-turner/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is common these days to find many Indians stating that Max Mueller was an India-hater and a hand-maid of Macaulay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Max Mueller was the son of a well-known German poet and influenced greatly by the German scholastic community of his era. His ideas should, hence, be viewed as a part of the continuum of the era.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Secondly, he never visited India so he definitely had a poor grasp of the first-hand subtilties of India. His information was also being filtered through the English Raj, which was obviously the only source.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;help-for-hindus&#34;&gt;Help for Hindus&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me point out what Swami Vivekananda, a great Indian reformer and patriot said about him:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Frontline warriors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/09/06/frontline-warriors/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The charge of the Indian brigade has been consistently plagued with the lack of proper frontline troops who can bear the cannon fire of uncouth, wild-eyed, gutter-mouthed barbarians like Brett Lee, Mcgrath and Pollock. In contrast, when India has to return the fire with the occassional exception of the over-used field gun, Shrinath, the rest of the guns typically fail to fire, or deliver noisy, but empty thunderbolds like Agarkar. The result is the now familiar rout and dispersal of Indian troops in any encounter with an average or better opposition on battle fields outside the subcontinent. The two factors are clearly linked: The inability to produce high velocity guns results in the inability to produce warriors who can fight when high velocity guns are being fired. As result the Indian army always teeters on the slow lane and panics when the heavy guns go off on the maidan-i-jangs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Malhotran theory of U-turns</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/09/03/the-malhotran-theory-of-u-turns/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Malhotra, proposed a theory that the Westerners or members of the Anglosphere, and its more extended fraternity, the Leukosphere, appropriate Hindu ideas through a process, which he terms the U-turn. We shall consider Malhotra’s shyness towards the “H” word and eagerness to work within the system later. In its basic form the U-turn theory states that a Leukospherite (roughly a White man or woman) first whole heartedly delves into the Hindu lore. Then he or she on attaining maturity starts seeing the knowledge gained from the Hindu world in his/her own culture. And the next thing you know they claim that it was always an integral part of their culture and start demonizing the parent Hindu lore and Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cult substructure</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/rivals/academia/articles/MT/cult-substructure/</link>

      <guid>https://hindutva.github.io/rivals/academia/articles/MT/cult-substructure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To expand: There are few points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Euro-American academia has a bit of a cult-like structure to it, i.e., there are certain beliefs that most of its practitioners don&amp;rsquo;t challenge. For e.g., at the highest level the peer-review/journal publication/impact factor fetish. Thus, practices which are harmful to the field or simply unethical (sophisticated plagiarism &amp;amp; fake result production) are rampant. The degree varies from field to field &amp;amp; has some correlation with how ethnically diverse it is. A field which is dominated by people of Western Euro&#xA;ancestry, with few non-Euro ancestry folks tends to be more susceptible for certain cult nostrums taking root. For e.g.,paleontology is predominantly peopled by such folk; thus, even though it is rather close to the foundations of biology, it is overrun by the fads of navyonmAda &amp;amp; many of its younger practitioners believe in contra-biological constructions of that unmAda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Snippets from some writings by an American woman Elizabeth Reed in the early 1900s illustrating some of the roots of the American strain of white indology. The peculiarly American conception of race consciousness was making its beginnings in indology. Remember this woman&amp;rsquo;s blatherings were studied as recommended textbooks in American colleges for years after her death. Her successors similar say similar things in more &amp;ldquo;sophisticated&amp;rdquo; language or the language of current usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hate mail</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/rivals/academia/articles/MT/hate-mail/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think it is not good behavior &amp;amp; reflects badly on H to be writing hate mail out of the blue. But I think like the nuclear no-first strike policy of the Indian state is a good guide: if the indologist/ activist is the 1st to strike on H then the retaliation should be in kind though ideally not by sending them hate mail unless they sent a particular H hate mail first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indologist Jason Schwartz summarizing Wagoner and Dick Eaton&amp;rsquo;s outrageous claims that are widely accepted in Occidental indology (just to be be clear I&amp;rsquo;m not endorsing it, and it is not clear if Schwartz accepts it serious himself):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A major argument of Richard Eaton and Phillip Wagoner, Power, Memory, Architecture: Contested Sites on India’s Deccan Plateau 1300-1600 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014) is that the Hindu-Muslim encounters of the early modern period need to be understood not as a clash of religions, but in terms of the complex interactions of two cultural and literary styles, that of Vijayanagara, nominally Hindu, and Sufi-inflected Persianate discourse of the Bahmani state, both of which sought to lay their claims upon the preexisting built landscapes that defined Deccani identity through its relation to the past, a past which included the cultural patrimony of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas as well as the Kākatīyas of Telangana. In this spirit, both authors point us towards what they argue was the respectful reusage of older early medieval material culture by later Deccani rulers who were both Hindu and Muslim.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Jones and Woodroffe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;William Jones was IMO was one of the most influential of the English. Some people answered John Woodroffe (to the question of who composed the English verses to Hindu Gods shown), not a bad choice if you guessed without cheating because his career closely parallels&amp;rsquo; Jones. I also wanted to do a segment on Jones but had to dig up some hard to find information that I finally did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both Jones and Woodroffe were judges who became sympathetic to the H tradition.Both their wives also became interested in H tradition. In the case of Woodroffe his wife made a Malhotra u-turn &amp;amp; dragged him along back to the preta-mata.+++(5)+++ I wanted to trace the case of Jones&amp;rsquo;s wife. All evidence suggests she did not waver unlike Woodroffe&amp;rsquo;s. One author has even suggested that they might have been crypto-H. Plausible - given lines in Her poem &amp;ldquo;Adieu to India&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Language prowess vs religion</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/rivals/academia/articles/MT/language-prowess_vs_religion/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Westerners who study Indian Languages as a full time profession are almost always subversionists, well integrated in the anti India ecosystem. Sadly they get too much limelight and support, way disproportionate to the worth of their scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I keep saying that in hierarchy of identities language should be below religion. Hence, delighting in poetry or grammar or linguistics is for me at an entirely lower level than the religious content presented in that medium. I take an even more drastic position that linguistics for linguistics sake is quite an empty exercise.+++(4)+++ It takes value only when it is a tool for cracking philological issues pertaining to the root culture of the language. Let us not forget that were not far from a Sanskrit speaking sultanate under the ghaznavids or have a Shaiste Khan spout a delicate vasantatilaka on the shapeliness of one of his begam-s below the burka that would get the Sanskritists nodding approvingly on the demonstration of vyAkaraNa &amp;amp; vR^itta. But Shaiste remains a Shaiste. The holiness the language comes from containing the first praises of the gods by our ancestors rather from something intrinsic to itself. Even if that were so it comes from identification of the phonemes with the deities.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/2025268293653660095&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As in every field of inquiry, the method, the knowledge, the capacity and the honesty of the practitioner matter much more than the credentials on paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take the example of the Western Sanskritist Jan Gonda, who had a degree in (occidental) Classics, mostly from a comparativist IE perspective, not a formal degree in Sanskrit. Yet he was the most prolific philologist of the Indian tradition without having ever set foot in the country. He achieved this because he had a sound method, extraordinary capacity and honesty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
