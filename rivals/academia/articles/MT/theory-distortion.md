As in every field of inquiry, the method, the knowledge, the capacity and the honesty of the practitioner matter much more than the credentials on paper.

Take the example of the Western Sanskritist Jan Gonda, who had a degree in (occidental) Classics, mostly from a comparativist IE perspective, not a formal degree in Sanskrit. Yet he was the most prolific philologist of the Indian tradition without having ever set foot in the country. He achieved this because he had a sound method, extraordinary capacity and honesty.

Similarly, Alexis Sanderson, the English Sanskritist, did not have a PhD, yet he was so sound in his approach that his work has outperformed a legion of PhD Sanskritists and historians.

In contrast, we have a trend that emerged in American universities, where something called "theory" started dominating over the empirical method in historical and philological studies. This is not theory in a scientific sense but the same word applied to ideological frameworks derived from "isms" of the left-liberal spectrum. Here rather than pursuing empirical leads from philology, epigraphy and archaeology you place the so-called "theory" in front of it and interpret everything via that lens. 

Here credentials matter a lot because otherwise you will not reproduce the distortion the "theory" wants via their lens, Unfortunately, the malaise has infected Indian philology and history both in the desh and beyond and the result is a series of suspect to rotten productions.
