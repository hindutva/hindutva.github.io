III. ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HINDUS IN TEXTBOOKS:  
  
**NOTE**: The key role in submitting corrections related to Hinduism in CA Textbooks was played by **The Hindu American Foundation**, and **The Vedic Foundation**. In the past, **India in Classrooms** has also initiated grassroots efforts on Bay Area schools to end stereotyping of Hinduism in schools. In the present controversy, **The Hindu American Foundation** initiated the first lawsuit against the State of CA in CA State courts. Soon thereafter, second generation Hindu American parents filed a separate lawsuit against the State of California in the Federal Courts, after forming an organization named **CAPEEM**.
