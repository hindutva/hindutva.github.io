Subject: Professional Opinion of an Academic Psychiatrist on Contents of CA Textbooks for Grade VI

I am compelled to write this letter in the capacity of a sensitive and caring professional, practicing academic psychiatrist who is deeply concerned about the healthy emotional and psycho-social development of children in our society. I am specifically referring to the negative effects of the content regarding Ancient India and Hinduism of proposed textbooks for the State of California on Grade VI students of tender and impressionable age and in a critical developmental phase.

Having followed this controversy over the last 2 months, as a mental health professional and provider, I have reviewed copies of several Grade VI and Grade VII books to evaluate how Ancient India and Hinduism were treated vis-a-vis other civilizations and religions. I am deeply pained to say that I find a lot bigotry and hatred towards Hinduism in these text-books:

- There is an obsessively negative focus on Hinduism without appreciating the positive and ego-enhancing aspects, whereas other religions are portrayed in a positive light.

- Religions such as Buddhism are specifically said to be an improvement over Hinduism.

- Complex Hindu beliefs are presented in a simplistic, trivialized and caricaturist manner.

- The authors of most textbooks seem to betray an overt bias against Indic religions in general and Hinduism in particular. For example, the scriptures of Indic traditions are called 'texts', ‘stories', ‘poems', but those of Judaism, Islam are called 'scriptures'.

- Abrahamic religions are described according to how their believers see them, whereas Hinduism is described according to how others (often hostile and self-opinionated “scholars”) perceive it.

- The role of women and lower castes in Hinduism is presented in a singularly demeaning manner. It is as if only Hinduism exploited women and sections of men in the ancient and medieval era.

- After reading the entire chapter(s) on ancient India and Hinduism, the students will rarely get any useful 'take-way' points except some negatives ('oppression of women', exploitation of lower castes). But in the case of other religions, they will be made to comprehend the fundamentals quite well from a sympathetic perspective.

- Hinduism is judged unfavorably using modern standards, whereas the ills of other religions (slavery, witch burning, polygamy, religious wars etc) are whitewashed.


The above facts could have a harmful effect in classrooms on all students, but on Indo- American and Hindu American students in particular. These students will be made to feel ashamed of their heritage, and may become objects of ridicule and scorn by their peers. Their heritage will be perceived as inferior by their peers due to poorly written textbooks. As a result, they would either want to deny their heritage completely (causing a lot of friction with their families) or even develop feelings of shame, embarrassment and inferiority. It could exacerbate development of poor self-esteem, learning difficulties, emotional and behavioral problems in impressionable students of these ethnic groups.

Peer pressure and acceptance becomes increasingly strong and irresistible in teenage years, and it is inappropriate to subject sixth grade students (10-12 years) to such a predominantly negative and patently biased presentation of their heritage. While it is desirable at the College level to expose students to both sides of the story, impressionable and delicate sixth grade students should be taught material that is positive, and reinforces a sense of self-confidence and pride in what they are.

Therefore, as an academician and as a practicing Psychiatrist, I believe that the textbooks, as they exist, are unsuitable for teaching about ancient India in general and Hinduism in particular to school children of sixth grade. I am afraid that fostering negativity may create a stigmatizing, demeaning and divisive education system in the great state of California in the third millennium.

Let me implore you to be more sensitive and responsive towards the emotional and psycho-social developmental needs of the Hindu American children in California. You do have a tremendous responsibility on your shoulders in creating fairness in school textbooks. Let us together make sure that history and posterity appreciate your positive efforts in creating a just, fair and non-stigmatizing society.

Should you have any further questions on this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me at my mobile 651-301-1077 or at my direct VAMC office telephone number (612-467-4938).

Yours truly,
