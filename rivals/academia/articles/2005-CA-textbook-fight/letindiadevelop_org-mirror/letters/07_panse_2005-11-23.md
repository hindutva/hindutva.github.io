**Re: Textbook revisions- an opportunity to correct errors**

**Dear President Green, Members of the Board and Members of the Curriculum Commission,**

Recent advancements in DNA sciences have resulted in acquittals of innocent individuals convicted of crimes they did not commit. Some indeed were on death rows, on the basis of foolproof evidence, only to walk free, dramatically. Because DNA said so.

Hard scientific evidence for our textbooks, in the form of DNA studies of populations, similarly cannot be refuted by any other means. DNA has debunked, for once and all, the “Aryan invasion” propaganda, and no worthy education should teach any untruths to our children.

It is thus our opportunity, indeed the duty, at this time to listen to the scientists, and free a religion and a culture from the still deadly ties of old colonialism. Because DNA says so.

It makes no difference how late in the game we bring forth the new scientific evidence. The courts in our country accept it, because it leads us to the Truth.

It makes no difference whatsoever what other evidence can be mustered, how impressive the credentials of any of the witnesses are, and how much political spinning or demagoguery against a religion some of the so-called intelligentsia engage in, as has taken place in the matter of California textbook revisions. The Hindu religion must be freed, because DNA says so.

Please note that individuals who attempt last minute suppression of corrections to textbooks for our future voters (see, e.g., the letter to you from Harvard, dated Nov. 8, 2005) do not profess any scientific knowledge or wish to bring the scientific studies to your attention. They attempt to snow the Board and the Commission with their resumes instead. They practice intellectual dishonesty, as they choose to ignore science in their purported fields of expertise, and ignore that even BBC, no friend of Hindus, has finally admitted the falsity of any Aryan invasion (see [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/history/history5.shtml.](https://web.archive.org/web/20110525204923/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/history/history5.shtml))

The attached abstract, so far published only on the internet, provides a brief analysis, with references to original articles in peer reviewed scientific journals. It summarizes what main-line reputed scientists have concluded from new DNA studies of different kinds of genes: that there was no “Aryan invasion.”

Further, please note that the 2004 article by Professor Bamshad et al., Deconstructing the Relationship Between Genetics and Race, in the highly reputed journal Nature Review Genetics, refutes any minor contrary views as due to sampling errors, etc.

We trust that you will follow the lead of all courts in our country, and honor published, hard scientific evidence to reach the Truth: there never was any “Aryan invasion.”

We trust further that you will ignore the discredited exerts also on other issues, and honor the Hindu scholars who have worked with you for quite some time.

Thank you very much for your time and your consideration.

Sincerely,
