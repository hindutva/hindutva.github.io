  <p>What is the core? Not the likes of the following, since hindus themselves make many such mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ridiculous translations from the Clay series brought out by Mr Pollock and co, arising from shaky grounding in Indian thought - <a href="https://twitter.com/suhasm/status/705307611630014464">TW16</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>These dry/ context-free scholars have tended to influence (very actively or otherwise) how Hindu traditions are summarized or presented to Hindus and non-hindu-s alike. Eg. The California case.</li>
<li>[To be edited.] Casting pro-hindutva people as fools (while deliberately ignoring savants on the hindutva side).</li>
<li>Subversion of the sikh-s by Max Arthur Macauliffe [<a href="https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/609722130368888832">T1</a>].
<ul>
<li>Abrahamized the sikhs even more.</li>
<li>Invented pro-british fake prophesies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<ul>
<li>Plenty are books produced by western Indologists and their acolytes which have attempted or inadvertently tended to subvert Hindu traditions with inimical narratives.
<ul>
<li>Hindu reviews site: <a href="http://hindureview.com/author/vishalagarwal/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Vishal Agarwal&rsquo;s review of Wendy Doniger&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Hindus: An Alternative History&rdquo; : <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/review/R15O4GR4A5HABO?sa-no-redirect=1">AM10</a>.</li>
<li>Early Indological work was heavily motivated by Evangelism.
<ul>
<li>Eg: The Monier-Williams / Max Muller race.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Imputing flawed racist narratives.
<ul>
<li>Prof. George Thompson on kRShNa (<a href="http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2012/04/george-thompson-as-case-study-in-racist.html">KE12</a>)</li>

Changes finally accepted: <a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/ag/ag/documents/hssnotice022706a1.pdf">CA</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2005CaliforniaTextbookFightCorrectionsAdapted">archive</a>.</li>
<li>CA textbooks hearing 2015: Omission of women [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0f2iCtW9BA&amp;feature=player_embedded">YT</a>], caricature of caste [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y7zt4LtBh8&amp;feature=youtu.be">YT</a>]</li>
<li>A presentation on what is taught about Hindu-s in textbooks (Hinduism Today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n9P59Y3z5U#t=1095">presentation</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Witzel, Pollock and many others launched a successful, concerted attempt to subvert positive changes brought to the coverage of the Hindu ethos in California textbooks. Witzel&rsquo;s congradulatory 2005 letter <a href="https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/07/15/sampling-from-indologist-subversion-during-the-2005-california-textbook-fight/">here</a>, where he next plans to target BBC.</li>
<li>Strategic errors on the Hindu side:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2013/10/hindu-noise-makers.html">KE10</a>: &quot; So, when in 2005 the school textbooks in California came up for review, two Hindu organizations proposed a series of edits to the chapter on Hinduism. Some were uncontroversial, e.g. replacing the photograph of a mosque with the caption &ldquo;Hindu temple&rdquo; by the photograph of a proper Hindu temple. Some were cases of intra-Hindu infighting, e.g. replacing the philosophical &ldquo;self-realization&rdquo; as the goal of Hinduism with the devotional &ldquo;God-realization&rdquo;. Outsiders who took an interest in this, could have an opinion on this, but it was not serious enough to warrant interference. But when Hindus proposed that &ldquo;the Aryan Invasion Theory is wrong&rdquo; and &ldquo;nobody believes in it anymore&rdquo;, a revolutionary c.q. a plainly wrong statement, this alerted a number of Hindu-bashing groups including several academics with a say in the Aryan question. What followed was procedurally not very kosher, with the academics gate-crashing into the debate with a very partisan stance being accepted by the educational authorities as arbiters to a controversy which they themselves had started. &quot;</li>
