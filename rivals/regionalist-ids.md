title: Regionalism
---

- Excess diversity in the wrong areas i.e. areas where diversity contributes to loss rather than gain in robustness. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/05/16/some-biological-analogies-for-certain-sociopolitical-issues/)\]
    - Eg. Scripts, regionalism.
- Regional rivalries can often be exploited by enemies of Hindus. Claiming to address genuine or imagined grievances, they can weaken the Hindu state. Example: "Dravidian" faultine and the Anglospheric interventions.

## Language
> (Regional) Language chauvinism is a front for secularism. Allows the other to claim to be part of the culture they seek to destroy.

> Indira’s third intervention framed rules perpetuating English in State institutions and as the sole medium of higher education, ending even the pretence of indigenisation --- another promise Nehru procrastinated by playing one Indic language against another, justifying the English-dominant status quo as “compromise” --- a stratagem straight from the Panchatantra tale of the monkey and quarrelling cats.

## As a foil
> Traditional trader V3s got into usury, as did various V1 and V4 jAtis with large landholdings who took a new avatar as tax farmers. This broke the unspoken social contract. However, native V3 and V4 that engaged in usury largely escaped the scrutiny through their participation in ethno-nationalist movements as the thinkers and drivers. The Chettiar-Mudaliar-Vellalar triumvirate of Dravidianism is a classic example.
