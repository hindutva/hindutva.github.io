Matters that should be considered by the Muslim leadership

Presently, there is widespread expressions and sentiments regarding the distressing situations of the Muslims driven out of Jaffna, and the imperative need for their re-settlement in their traditional habitat. Discussions have now become a matter of routine in a political sense. The mid-nineties saw a wide cleavage in Tamil - Muslim relationships resulting in the driving out of the Muslims from the north; there can be no doubt about their re- settlement. But, at the same time, during the same period, the Eastern Province too witnessed similar events; the Tamils living in their traditional regions too were driven out of their homes by Muslims: displacement to other areas etc. In that context, there is the necessity to take into consideration the plight of such displaced Tamils too to be re-settled in their areas earlier occupied by them.

Eelam War II set in motion a calculated series of aggressive attacks by the Shri Lankan Security Forces against the Tamils of the Eastern province. The process of genocide of the Tamils' or the 'De-reliction of the Tamils' by the Security forces received the active support from both the Muslim militancy as well as the Muslim politicians. In particular, Ampara District which had a permanent and long-standing Tamil population of thousands of families, were subjected to all forms of violence by both the Muslim hooligans and Muslim Home Guards.

When I refer to the word 'Muslims', it undoubtedly refers specifically attributed to the destructive activities by Muslim Home Guards, Muslim Hooligans and the Muslim politicians. By this process, they ensured the compulsory displacement of the Tamils from their traditional habitat and to strengthen their own positions with ulterior motives. The fact that the security forces went on the rampage in Tamil regions in the Ampara District paved the way for the Muslim forces to plan and carry out calculated activities to achieve their objectives.+++(5)+++

In the process of destruction directed against the Tamils, the community lost a number of the educated Tamil intelligentsia. Several Hindu Temples were set on fire and destroyed. The Tamils lost all their belongings including houses, agricultural lands, movable and immovable properties. They were compelled to vacate their traditional villages and move out to safer areas.

The Muslims who acquired both political as well as economic strengths utilized the terrific war situation to establish and seize by force a political platform to suit their needs. Result: Ampara District, portions of which were once under Tamil regimes over a period of traditional occupation with a proud heritage overnight became alien property. Hindu Temples with centuries-old heritage, which contributed to their moral and religious ways of life, were destroyed completely leaving no traces. Tamil villages in the District such as Palamunai, Panama, Meem Odai Kaddu, Oluvil, Nintawr, Samnlanthurai, Karavalupattu, Deegavapi, Maanthoddam, Kondavedduva, Poorani, Chemmanilwlam, Thangavelauthaplram, Udumpankulam, are strange lands to the Tamil community having been converted to Muslim areas. Moreover, other Tamil villages with a preponderant Tamil population, namely, Addapallam, Chavalakadai, Thiraaikemi, Sorrikalmunai, Veeracholai are nay facing eminent dangers of being engulfed by Muslims using their political and economic machinations. All forms of destructive activities directed by the security forces against the Tamil community as well as their economic targets, paved the way for the Muslims to reap the harvest and strengthen their position. Tamils were murdered systematically on a planned basis. The remaining Tamils were strangled economically with no prospects of carrying out farming activities, marketing their produce or even moving freely without fear. The sole objective was to drive out the remaining Tamils from their villages. For that purpose, it was calculated to erase out their heritage which came under the umbrella of 'Hindu Worship'. Destructive activities were directed against the Hindu Temples in all the villages. Here are a few examples:

Sammanthurai - Kali Amman Temple destroyed by the Muslims in 1190.

Karaitivu - Kannaki Amman Temple damaged by the Muslims who accompanied the forces.

Addaipallam - Meenachchi Amman Temple damaged by the Muslims during the same period.

Karavalu - A village in close proximity to Kalmunai - An ancient Kali Kovil completely destroyed by Muslims. At present, a Mosque stands at that - place.

Meen Odai Kaddu - Pillaiyar Temple completely destroyed by Muslims. Muslim community settled at that site.

Oddamavadi - Batticaloa District - Pillaiyar Temple taken over forcibly by Muslim. A Beef Stall stands there now.

The Tamils of Ampara are deeply grieved over the several instances of the destructions caused to their places of worship as well as other horrendous acts of violence caused to their kith and kin. Here is an unforgettable incident: In 1990, Nintavur village was rounded up by the security forces and Muslim Home Guards; 64 youths males and females were taken to the Nintavur Murugan Temple. They were slain and shot. Those killed and the groaning lot were set on fire along with the temple. The strange thing is that there is no trace of the existence of a temple at that site which was once a recognised place of worship. This area, is now one where no Tamils can go into it and it is now a Muslim region.

Tiraikerui - An incident of aggression by Muslim hooligans in 1990. Muslim Hooligans armed with swords and knives entered the village and terrified the villagere. They sough t refuge in their village Pillaiyar Temple. The hooligans after damaging the temple entrance door attacked the helpless victims using their destructive weapons and after they were killed set the temple on fire.

Veeramunai - During the same time, refugees who were accomodated in the Pillaiyar Temple; they were rounded up by the Security forces and the Muslim Home Guards.

They selected the educated and the well-built youths numbering 85, took them inside the temple premises; they were slain and Shot by the Muslim Home Guards.

This particular incident took place in the presence of the relatives of those killed - When the security forces were simply watching While the Muslim Home Guards performed these horrible murders. Ampara Tamils often tell such similar stories through their experiences.

The Tamils of these regions did not have the courage and the strength to fight the politically strong Muslim leadership who gave all the help and assistance to the Muslim, Home Guards and the hooligans to carry out their plans to destroy the Tamils, the reason being that the remaining Tamils were economically bad as they were victims in every sense; and more so because their children were drawn into the liberation struggle which compelled them to remain silent spectators. The fact is, the prevailing situation at that time made them a complete helpless lot unable to voice their sentiments. There is yet another situation. There were cries for 'separate Muslim region'and 'Maritime Muslim District' from the strong Muslim political Leadership. They were not only participant in a Government; but also held positions to make or unmake governments. With that strength, they were able to voice their sentiments and make loud their slogans to receive the active support of the government of the day. The Tamils of the region were politically bankrupt with no representation; hence their grievances could not be spotlighted. The Rights of the Tamils were not only denied nut also prevented for the very same reasons.

It was the usual practice of the local politicos to release some reports for the sake of doing it; while waiting for the next opportunity to receive their favours from the government of the day. There seems to be no efforts on their part to launch a struggle with peoples' support or to expose the atrocities to the outside world; their hands were tied and also tight-lipped.

There is also no record of any effort by anyone to spotlight the destructions caused to Hindu Temples by the Muslims to the notice of organisations like the Indian 'Vishva Hindu Parishad', and cause embarrassment to those concerned as well is the Shri Lankan Govt.

They simply remained silent knowing fully well that their voices will not be heard; they were concerned only for their own survival. The only philosophy preached by them was' God will root out'.

We hear of various slogans like: ' Muslims of the North should be re-settled traditional, lands taken by force to be handed over to the owners ' - are often heard from both Muslim leadership and reasonable Tamil leaderships. In that context, it becomes imperative that the cause of the Ampara District Tamils too should be spotlighted on a similar footing. With the on-going war situation over a length of time, the Ampara Tamils who were subjected to all sorts of inhumane and atrocious activities have suffered immense hardships. Their traditional lands too were secured either by force or malicious means by Muslims. Such lands too should be handed over to these who occupied them.

Summarising the siutation of the Ampara Tamils, the under-mentioned matters should be considered:

1. Traditional lands of those occupied by them prior to the war and subsequently taken by force by the Muslims should be handed over back to the owners.

2. Hindu Temples destroyed should be re-constructed.

3. Those areas which housed the Hindu Temples and presently colonised by Muslims should be freed.

4. Those involved in violent activities directed against the Tamils should be identified and brought before Courts for meeting justice.

5. Affected victims should be adequately compensated taking into account their losses and their extent.

6. Regions which have majority Muslim population with a minority, Tamil population should be adequately provided with a trusted security system so as to afford protection to the life and the households of the minority Tamils.

7. We are the sole representatives of the Muslims. - if the Shri Lanka Muslim Congress is sincere about this slogan, and, as they are partners of the Government, they should come forward and strive to give effect to the above - mentioned matters.
