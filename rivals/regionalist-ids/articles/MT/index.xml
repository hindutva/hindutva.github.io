      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/12/04/dravidianism/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that the Dravidian movement must be seen in a certain contextual framework.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reaction-to-christian-doctrine&#34;&gt;Reaction to Christian doctrine&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we must note that the Indians faced something unprecedented with the dawn of the British Raj. In areas where the British were prominent before the war of 1857, the indoctrination of covert Christian ideals and English superiority was underway for a while. After 1857 it spread all over the country. The Indians faced with this indoctrination reacted regionally in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/11/17/the-dravidians-emerge-from-the-woodwork/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recent incidents in India have resulted in the Dravidians emerging like worms from the woodwork. In practically every Indian list one can now see them floating their anti-Brahmin rhetoric. A few hopeful brAhmaNas had told me just a few months ago that the Dravidianists were on the wane. I always doubted this. The Tamils are too useful a tool for foreign subversionists to use against the metaphorical head of the puruSha. I had also earlier pointed out that the brAhmaNas had cashed their cheques and are currently a rather spent force.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
