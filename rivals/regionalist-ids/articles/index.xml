      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555893348321284096.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After IMK broke the EVR Statue in Srirangam set off an unprecedented chain of violence against hindu temples and brahmins in the state (Dec 2006). This is unreported or under-reported in the national or tamil news media till date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ayodhya-mandapam-attacked-with-petrol-and-acid-bombs&#34;&gt;Ayodhya Mandapam attacked with Petrol and Acid bombs.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sri Ram Samaj also known as Ayodhya Mandapam is a well known Ram temple and religious centre in the heart of Chennai in West Mambalam. Around 330PM on Dec 8th around 15 dravidian activists allegedly descended on the temple in two autorickshaws with deadly weapons and shouted “Dont spare anyone who wears sacred thread, or marks on their head Tilak or Vibhuti, thrash them” at passers by. Then they proceeded to attack the temple. First they threw an acid bomb into the temple complex, the acid struck a screen which caught fire. When devotees rushed to douse the flames, the activists hurled a petrol bomb on the idol outside the temple and another inside the temple. They shouted this was in revenge for the damage caused to the EVR Periyar statue kept outside the world famous Sri Ranganath Swamy temple in Srirangam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Damil desIyam</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/im_saiganesh/status/1883207063633092990&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The end goals of Tamil Desiyam and Dravidam are fundamentally the same. Both ideologies share a common agenda and end goals for what they aim to achieve, but their methods and approaches differ. Ultimately, neither is beneficial for India.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dravidam carries a significant amount of historical baggage. It sees Periyar as its ideological father, whose many controversial statements remain unacceptable to the common man. Despite holding power for decades, Dravidam has failed to achieve its original objectives. While the political parties associated with it may have benefited from their time in power, the broader ideological goals with which the movement began remain unfulfilled. Recognizing this failure, Dravidam seeks to evolve, refine, and rebrand itself to shed the negative baggage it has accumulated over the past century. This attempt at reinvention has given rise to Tamil Desiyam, which is a modernized version of Dravidam’s ideology, repackaged to appeal to the present-day audience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the worship site, there were free meals offered to guests. To Ramasamy&amp;rsquo;s shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Ramasamy&amp;rsquo;s entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Foil for usury</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Suren&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditional trader V3s got into usury, as did various V1 and V4 jAtis with large landholdings who took a new avatar as tax farmers. This broke the unspoken social contract. However, native V3 and V4 that engaged in usury largely escaped the scrutiny through their participation in ethno-nationalist movements as the thinkers and drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Chettiar-Mudaliar-Vellalar triumvirate of Dravidianism is a classic example. They were all moneylenders, tax farmers and bureaucrats who has gotten rich off of the British Empire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailymirror.lk/2003/10/22/opinion/2.asp&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Matters that should be considered by the Muslim leadership&lt;br&gt;&#xA;By Niraj David&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Point of View&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The Daily Mirror&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Wednesday, October 22, 2003&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presently, there is widespread expressions and sentiments regarding the distressing situations of the Muslims driven out of Jaffna, and the imperative need for their re-settlement in their traditional habitat. Discussions have now become a matter of routine in a political sense. The mid-nineties saw a wide cleavage in Tamil - Muslim relationships resulting in the driving out of the Muslims from the north; there can be no doubt about their re- settlement. But, at the same time, during the same period, the Eastern Province too witnessed similar events; the Tamils living in their traditional regions too were driven out of their homes by Muslims: displacement to other areas etc. In that context, there is the necessity to take into consideration the plight of such displaced Tamils too to be re-settled in their areas earlier occupied by them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
