The end goals of Tamil Desiyam and Dravidam are fundamentally the same. Both ideologies share a common agenda and end goals for what they aim to achieve, but their methods and approaches differ. Ultimately, neither is beneficial for India.

Dravidam carries a significant amount of historical baggage. It sees Periyar as its ideological father, whose many controversial statements remain unacceptable to the common man. Despite holding power for decades, Dravidam has failed to achieve its original objectives. While the political parties associated with it may have benefited from their time in power, the broader ideological goals with which the movement began remain unfulfilled. Recognizing this failure, Dravidam seeks to evolve, refine, and rebrand itself to shed the negative baggage it has accumulated over the past century. This attempt at reinvention has given rise to Tamil Desiyam, which is a modernized version of Dravidam’s ideology, repackaged to appeal to the present-day audience.

Tamil Desiyam’s opposition to Dravidam or its criticism of Periyar doesn’t make it truly different or better when it comes to its ultimate goal. Criticizing Periyar or trying to distance itself from the flaws of Dravidam is just a strategy - a way to make its ideas seem more acceptable. However, this is only a tactic, not the actual goal of the ideology. The end goal of both ideologies is the same, and it will bring no good to the country, the state, or the people - it will only cause harm.

Seeman’s criticism of Periyar doesn’t mean his plans are different from the Dravidian ideology. It’s just a different way to achieve the same goal. People need to see this clearly and not fall for these political narratives without understanding the bigger picture. Periyar is like a vehicle - only the vehicle is being replaced here, not the destination. The end goal of both Periyar and Seeman are same.
