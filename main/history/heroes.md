title: Heroes महानुभावाः
---




## Preface:

Here I list some great personalities I personally admire. Note: Hindu sounds are encoded in the latin alphabet using [OPTITRANS](http://sanskritnlp.appspot.com/optitrans.html).

### Definition and critique:  

Every person has some noble and some ignoble qualities. What makes a hero? A hero is a person, who may be flawed, but persistently develops and displays (personally and socially) noble traits, and does great deeds.

Heroes do not function in a vaccum: rather, they are able achieve their deeds building upon the deeds of others, and only due to cooperation and help from others. Of course, one should remember that the traits themselves should be the focus of admiration, and one should not descend to chauvinism which tries to deny unpleasent truths about these people.

### My reasons:  

Why heroes? Stories of heros are often riveting; remembering their stories is an important part of cultivating a self which strives for these qualities when appropriate. Why heroes from bhArata? I am emotionally (and biologically) attached to this 5000+ year old culture and people; so the inspiration I can draw from them is much stronger.  

Why make a list? Maybe this interests others. Helps organize my thoughts on the matter, frees up my overly engrossed mind to pursue other interests.

### Days of the early epics

[![kRRiShNArjuna](http://larryavisbrown.homestead.com/files/arjuna_Krishna_chariot.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnbJxbUMI8s)



- manu vaisvata, pitR, the likely progenitor of 100M of us R1a carrying Indo Aryans \[[MT](../https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/05/08/the-giants-among-the-lilliputs/)\], first king of the solar dynasties, a the great lawgiver and ritualist, who among other things sagely advised wariness towards shUdra-s and mlecCha-s of his time \[[here](../social-cultivation/clan/ethnic-shifts/Arya-invasion/)\].
    - वैवस्वतो मनुर् नाम माननीयो मनीषिणाम्। आसीन् महीक्षिताम् आद्यः प्रणवश् छन्दसाम् इव॥ इति कालिदासः। 
- Others listed in ([SV](https://sites.google.com/site/samskrtamsfo/kavyam/itihasah/vansah/bhargavah)) and allied pages. Especially 
    - [parashu-rAma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parashurama), the bhArgava revolutionary; and other bhArgava heroes .

### panchajana-wave

- sudAsa (contemporary of purukutsa) of the uttara-pAnchAlas, great grandson of rAjarShi divodAsa (RV mandala 6), who won the 10 king war, much honored in the veda-s.
  - "We come across an interesting account in the mahābhārata, which only mentions the defeat of saṃvaraṇa, the then king of the main hastināpura line at the hands of an unnamed "pañcala king" who went to "conquer the earth" with several akṣauhiṇīs of troops in all directions. The great king of the kurus, the first among equals to be called the "bhāratas"; saṃvaraṇa was defeated & had to flee far west. How far? To the west of the sindhū river! Such was the terrifying vīrapratāpaḥ of one blessed by indra, sudāsa of eternal fame. Now, the sāmaveda's jaiminīya brāhmaṇa speaks of "bhāratas" residing on the west of sindhū river during a difficult time but doesn't mention the name of the king of the bhāratas."
  - He appears in RV 3rd: when his purohita was a vaiśvāmitra ṛṣi and RV 7th: when a vāsiṣṭha ṛṣi is his purohita here (the lore of the vasiShTha-vidveShi verses of vaishvAmitras are pertinent here).
- trasadasyu, born to Purukutsa by his wife, Purukutsānī, at a time of great distress, energetic king of the purus settled along the sarasvatI,  a famous sacrificer of ancient times.
- bhIShma, the one of the steadfast vow, who repulsed the attack of the cruel ugrāyudha the pAnchAla (grandson of noble dvimIDhas), who .
- kRShNa, leader of the yadu-s, who likely repulsed the sAlva invasion historically \[[SS](http://www.oocities.org/somasushma/dalbhya.html)\], famously naughty and \*\*violent\*\* as a kid \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/08/27/the-dark-hero-of-the-yadus/)\], great guide, clever manipulator, the symbol of dharma in action at the social level (his role as a personification of the universe's mockery of silly humans' best plans and dharmas is entirely separate).

### ikShvAku wave

- bhagIratha, whose stupendous determination brought ganga to the earth and pAtAla, liberating his forefathers.
- janaka, knower of brahman, patron of brAhmaNa-s.
- [rAma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama), rAjA of ayodhyA, maryAdA-puruShOttama, keeper of the dharma, the symbol of family-consciousness.
    - On his abandonment of sItA: uttarakANDa is probably a a later insert into the epic. Nevertheless, rAma gets criticized in sanskrit literature (eg: kAlidAsa puts regret in rAma's mouth in raghuvaMsha). Also, a fair analysis [here](http://prekshaa.blogspot.com/2010/03/abandoning-of-sita.html?m=1). 
    - Killing the shUdra sage shambuka for the protection of dharma: A simple jAti-tapas dissociation does not fit well with the character who gladly eats fruit soiled by shabarI, who embraces guha the king of niShAda-s.
        - nArada's statement: "“...a man of the lowest caste may not give himself up to penance in the Dwapara Yuga; it is only in the Kali Yuga that the practice of asceticism is permitted to the Shudra caste."  

        - Wiki: "The apologetics[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambuka#cite_note-7) firstly argue that not all tapas is done for a pious purpose. [Ravana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravana "Ravana"), a Brahmin killed by Rama, had also performed penance but not for pious reasons. They argue that Shambuka was killed for conducting penance with a motive of attaining a celestial power with his material body, which is not an unselfish motive for which penance is meant to be performed. It is particularly forbidden (e.g. story of [Trishanku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishanku "Trishanku")) in [Hindu mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_mythology "Hindu mythology") to aspire for entering heaven with a material body. The belief is that the material body, i.e. Annamaya [Kosha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha "Kosha"), is mortal and is meant only for performing ones [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma "Karma") on earth."
- vibhIShaNa, who defected to do the right thing.
- satya-[harIshachandra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harishchandra), who did not forsake the truth.

### kuru-s among puru-s

- vidura, the dAsI-putra, wise and honest counselor.
- yuyutsu, son of dhRtarAShTra from gAndhArI's vaishya maid, who aided the pANDava-s and the upholding of dharma in their contest against his own kaurava kin.
- vikarNa, the noble kaurava, who like yuyutsu vocally abhorred kaurava adharma, but stayed loyal to family, as is proper.
- shakunI, clever manipulator - one man felled the entire kuru clan.
- karNa, dAna-vIra-shUra, generous king, loyal friend, great warrior.  


### pANDava wave

- bhIma, so filled with kShatra and power, taunted his enemies, exacted his revenge by plucking out the beating heart of duHshAsana and eating it, before dying draupadii's hair with that blood. But more - he knew dharma (and thus counselled and scolded yudhiShThira as necessary). Knowing the difference between greater and lesser dharma, who killed an elephant on his side named ashvatthAman and told droNa of it, draining his will to fight. Who showed great composure at the death of his son, ghaTotkacha {[PS18](https://medium.com/@pranasutra/bhima-vairagya-the-death-of-ghatotkacha-a256b26289d5)}. Of whom madhva said: "भक्तिर्ज्ञानं सवैराग्यं प्रज्ञा मेधा धृतिः स्थिथिः। योगः प्राणो बलं चैव वृकोदर इति स्मृतः॥"
- draupadii pAnchAlI of five husbands, who desired and obtained revenge for her humiliation.
- abhimanyu, the hero who entered and died in a trap.

- kaniShka the kuShAna, mahArajAdhiraja (Emperor of India), Kaisara (for the romans), Kshatriya-tama (for the Persians), and deva-putra (for the Chinese), one of the rare Indian powers who defeated the Chinese and kept them at bay, under whom the kaumAra-shAsana rose in hindu thoughtscape; under whom sogdiana was referred to by the chIna-s as uttarApatha; under whom Indic thought flowed over to central asia. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/26/chinese-policy-of-kushanas/)\] 

Non-heroes: ashOka chakravartI dEvanAmapriya, who - contrary to legend - did not give up warfare after the kaLinga carnage, who led to a decline in brAhmaNa patronage.  

### Era of invasions of shakas and huNas, consolidations:

[![ajantA](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Ajanta_cave9_2010.jpg/511px-Ajanta_cave9_2010.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKT-Gaf0cKo)

- skandagupta, who defeated the shveta-huNa invaders, whose western wing led by Attilla had recently defeated Romans, had trounced the Persians ([MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/geopolitics-of-the-tantra-age-an-attempt-at-a-blunt-assessment/)).
- bhadravarman, ruler of champa, reigned from 380CE to 413 CE and Sanskrit inscriptions from his reign show that he had learned the recitation of the vedic saMhitA-s and performed vedic rituals. He calls himself a devotee of rudra, and he celebrated the grace of rudra in securing his victory over the chIna-s by building the glorious temple for shiva termed shrI bhadreshvara. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/02/15/the-greatest-temple-of-shiva/)\]

She was the grandmother, through her daughter of pratAparudra, her successor.

- raghunAtha nArAyaNa hanmante, author of  rAjavyavahArakosha ([ref](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/536370856206020609)), who left the service of Tanjore's Ekoji (aka vyAnkoji) Bhonsle to join his half-brother the brilliant shivAji, who counselled merciful quelling of ekoji's despicable forwarding of muhammedan interests.

- Santaji Mhaloji Ghorpade, (1660-1696) of the broader bhosale community, named by Shivaji on his death bed to be among six pillars of Maratha Empire, who in a daring feat cut the ropes of Aurangzeb’s tents and took the imperial golden pinnacles and fled boosting marATha morale and confidence, argued oft with rAjArAm over decisions and was sacked.
- hambirrAv mohite, commander in chief of shivAjI and shambhu, father of Tarabai.
    -  In early 1676, Hambirrao led a daring raid into Mughal territory as far as Bharuch in Gujarat & after much heroic fighting, brought back a large booty to the Raigad treasury. Later, during the karNATaka campaign, when shivAji had to rush back to raigarh, hambirrAv defeated Adil shAh armies and Ekoji.
    - During the attack on diler khAn and mogols while aiding Adil shAh - he saved shivAji's trapped army and trounced diler's army.
    - He harassed the mogols under sambAji- "Shahabuddin Khan, father of Nizam-ul-Mulk, advanced with a huge army to take Raigad. Crisis once again! And yet again it was Hambirrao's cavalry which fell upon d besiegers routing them completely! Hambirrao immediately followed that up with another counter attack. 60 miles South East of Pune, Aurangzeb had setup an elephant stable with a large number of elephants. Hambirrao's cavalry swooped down upon it, massacred the Mughal garrison drove off d entire herd of elephants! ... Shivaji had massacred Afzal Khan's army in the forests below Pratapgad. It was Sarja's turn now. Hambirrao drew Sarja Khan's army deeper into the dense jungles around Mahabaleshwar & suddenly fell upon them. ... The Mughals were completely surrounded & massacred. But just at that moment of a decisive victory a most tragic event happened. Hambirrao was hit by a stray gun shot & fell dead.".
        - "Then the Mogol mined two of the hill slopes leading up to Mahabaleshwar plateau where the Maharattas were stationed and filling them with explosives, detonated it. Shaken by these two explosions the Maharattas began to flee helter-skelter. The Mogols soon rolled their heavy artillery and opened heavy fire on Hambirrao’s army. Hambirrao realized that his men would not hold out much longer and a defeat more or less guaranteed the end the Maharatta resistance to the Mogols in Maharashtra. Unless he turned the tide right there there was no hope stopping the Mogols from marching right through. With a chosen group of 100 ace commandos he rushed straight at Sarja Khan with the aim of killing him. This Maharatta band fought with unbelievable fury leaving a lane of blood and severed heads through the Mogol army. The swordsmanship of Mohite was unrivalled as he cut deep into the Mogol troops bringing down all before him and reaching the artillery line. His men fell upon the Mogol heavy artillery and destroyed the operators and wetted the powder. Seeing the tables turning, the fleeing rank and file of the Maharatta army recovered and fell upon the Mogols with renewed fury. The Mogols were completely swept away by the attack destroyed. However, in the midst of this Sarja Khan surrounded Hambirrao. The Mohite’s horse was shot down under him, but he continued fighting on foot and struck Sarja with his sword killing him. He was attacked on all sides and his strength was ebbing from the cuts he received. But leaning against a tree Hambirrao continued fighting keeping the Moslem assilants at bay till head was finally cut off. However, the surge of the Maharatta army was so great that the Mogol army was completely destroyed." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/06/02/the-death-of-hambirrao/)\]
    - "But the cost of this last great victory of the Maharatta army in Sambhaji’s reign was most expensive. In intelligent leadership, knowledge of the terrain and strategy, Hambirrao had been unmatched. Further, he was the only one who had dared to challenge Kalash and mitigate his negative effect on Sambhaji. As Kincaid the British commentator states, had the brave Hambirrao lived he had all the skill and resources to repulse the Mogol offensive. But with his death the Maharatta army in Maharashtra became rudderless. This was followed soon after by Sambhaji’s capture and execution by the Mogols."

- tArAbAyi, wife of rAjArAm, daugher of hambIr-rAv, who kept up the fight against the mughal-s.
    - She was later sidelined by a newly released shAhu and bAlAjI vishvanAtha. She propped up an impostor ( Rajaram II) and attempted various vain strategems - only to be foiled by bAlAjI. "On 14 September 1752, the two took oaths at Khandoba temple in Jejuri, promising mutual peace. At this oath ceremony, Tarabai also swore that Rajaram II was not her grandson, but an impostor from the Gondhali caste.\[6\] Nevertheless, Peshwa retained Rajaram II as the titular Chhhatrapati and a powerless figurehead."

"Balaji convinced Shahu to alter Shivaji's old constitution of the Maratha state, whereby the nobles were salaried employees of the ruler. Henceforth, nobles would be feudatories with grants of land over which they ruled as vassal princes." "The Maratha tax collection system from a wide swathe of nominally Mughal provinces was based on a widespread network of agents and collectors."

"Baji Rao was more conciliatory & preferred to work with the Rajputs. On the Rajput side too there were leaders like Sawai Jai Singh (of the Jantar Mantar fame) who were cooperative for the sake of Hindu interests. Later Peshwa's & Maratha's lost sight of this (e.g. Bhau's quarrel with Suraj Mal on the eve of Panipat)."

The followers of the Sapha Hor also did not take pigs or fowls nor did they drink toddy or pachwai. While the Sapha Hor was santals and half way to Hinduism, the Satyam Shibams were full-fledged Hindus. Both these sects had adopted the principles of pollution and purification of the Hindus. Kashishwar Chakraborty selected his favourite disciples from every village and conferred him with the title sardar. Every sardar received the particular cloth, turban and a piece of silver, in which the words " Satyam Shibam Sundaram" were inscribed.

        - "The treacherous conduct of a very large section of the Moslems in India in the Khilaphat (sic) agitation during the last Great War in 1914 has taught us a lesson never to be forgotten as it is almost sure to be repeated in any future attack on India on the North Western Frontier by any alien power. The tribesmen and the Moslem forces throughout Punjab, Sindh etc. are very likely to betray the Hindus and rise en masse in pursuance of the pan-Islamic designs to carve out an independent Moslem State or Federation stretching out from Baluchisthan–to Kashmir–to Delhi. In view of the attitude of many a responsible Moslem Organisation in India as revealed by their resolutions passed in their open sessions betraying their extra territorial sympathies it would be nothing short of a suicidal and purblind step on the part of the Hindus to make light of this serious danger threatening them. Under such an emergency they will have to ally themselves with the British forces in the common objective to avert this National calamity.”
        - "There is no question of co-operating or non-co-operating with the British Government in their war-efforts. The only question that you have before you is to find out how best you can turn this inevitable co-operation with the British as profitable to your own country as it is possible under our present circumstances to do." “Let the Hindus therefore come forward now and enter the army, the navy and the air-forces, the ordnance and other war-crafts factories in their thousands and millions.”

Our Raman, Sivaji, Krishnan, Guru Govindan, Arjuna ruled our land protecting all dharmas and in this land they are making arrangements to crown George V, a mlecha, and one who eats the flesh of cows. Three thousand Madrasees have taken a vow to kill George V as soon as he lands in our country. In order to make others know our intention, I who am the least in the company, have done this deed this day. This is what everyone in Hindustan should consider it as his duty."

- [kEshav baLIrAm hEDagEvAr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._B._Hedgewar), hindu svarAjya activist, social reformer, RSS founder.
- [vallabh bhAi paTEl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallabhbhai_Patel), Iron man of India, who dealt with the razAkar thugs of HyderAbAd, ensured accession of junAgarh and kAshmIr, who rebuilt sOmanAtha-shivAlaya.
- bhIm rAv [ambeDkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar), who strived for respect and opportunities for the untouchable jAti-s (sAvarkar on him: [img1](../../../images/snippets/sAvarkar-on-ambeDkar.jpg)) \- even at the cost of hinduism or Indian independence, an intelligent subversive inimical to hindus, used Christian categories to accomplish this (JDRoover [here](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/counterview-ambedkar-was-wrong-about-hinduism-the-right-can-stop-trying-to-appropriate-him)), who transformed into a hindu cultural nationalist ally (CR[1](http://centreright.in/2012/04/bodhi-sattvas-hindutva-part-1/), [ambedkar_partition](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/), sanskrit promotion [P1](http://i.imgur.com/h6N5vQ2.jpg) [T194909](https://twitter.com/Parikramah/status/582703386337792000),  ..) when circumstances made the continuation of British empire unlikely, and ultimately strived to ensure that dalita-s stay within the fold of dhArmic religions while rejecting caste hindu orthodoxy \[[T1936](https://twitter.com/parikramah/status/582704308262555648)\], a [clear thinker](http://www.ambedkar.org/pakistan/40C.Pakistan%20or%20the%20Partition%20of%20India%20PART%20II.htm) in regards to the security of hindustAn. 
    - "His education, encouraged and financed largely by the Gaikwad of Baroda, led to his role as the Untouchable's chief spokesman, the founder of a political party for Untouchables, and the moving spirit behind organizations, schools, and colleges established for their uplift."
    - It is clear that bhImrAv Ambedkar was not an advocate of Indian independence (if not openly against it at times). For example, AruN Shourie says about him \[[htm](http://www.rediff.com/freedom/29ambed1.htm) , [IMG](../../../images/snippets/wavell-on-ambeDkar.png)\]: "The Untouchables have stayed out of the Freedom Movement for good and strong reasons, he says again and again."
    - His efforts to reactivate the mAhar regiment in the British army was only motivated by the desire for social upliftment rather than the "learn to fight and rebel" hopes of Savarkar.
    - bhImrAv was (mostly willingly) a sort of enemy agent (someone used by the Brits to weaken and fracture the high caste Hindu dominated Indian independence movement). We would have got rid of untouchability etc.. (as the Japanese, Koreans, French and Spaniards did) without him as well, while preserving more of a feeling of national brotherhood. But he was somehow pumped up, like the khujliwal of Delhi. (That British would use these dalit leaders to subvert and fracture the hindus who were demanding that they leave is a no-brainer.)
    - "In the 1930s and 40s, like other acclaimed heroes of social reform such as M.N. Roy and Periyar Ramaswamy Naicker, Dr. Ambedkar was literally a paid agent of the British, even becoming the Member for Labour of the Viceroy's Council." ([KE](http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/books/wiah/ch11.htm))
    - This he did collude with the Brits (his big bet) and the preta-s. \[eg [here](http://www.sakshitimes.net/blog/2008/09/22/dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-defender-of-conversions-and-a-friend-of-christianity-294/)\] It is only late in his life, after his attempts to convince the Brits to rule on with dalit help failed \[[AS_Redif](https://www.rediff.com/freedom/29ambed.htm), [WP](https://aryasamajvserranthindus.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/dalits-helped-british-conquer-india-b-r-ambedkar/)\] that he decided to tie dalit fate with buddhists so as to not denationalize them from the Hindu society where they found themselves.
    - All this said, I do not begrudge bhImrAv - an intelligent enemy is better than a stupid friend. He knew when it was time to leave his treachery be. In that sense, it was far better that we deal with him than upper caste stupid "friends" such as the baldie and the chacha (without offence intended to anyone, this holds true today too).
    - Among his bad legacies is a constitution that deviated from the spirit of the hindu dharmashAstra-s (../explained [here](../social-cultivation/dharma/)).
- [nAlvaDi kRShNarAja vaDiyAr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalvadi_Krishnaraja_Wodeyar); rAjarShi of mysUru ("the best administered state in the world"), among whose diivAn-s was mokShaguNDam vishveshvarayya (another being school friend mirza ismail), patron of yogi-s, art and culture, first chancellor and patron of BHU, himself was an accomplished musician (knowing 8 instruments). \[[TW](https://twitter.com/adikulk/status/893381975440064512)\]  
- K "Arya" bhAShyam, a shrIvaiShNava, who as a 25 year old on 26th January 1932 at 2 am shinned up the 148-foot flag post in Fort St George, tore up the Union jack and erected the Indian flag; thence sent to Cellular jail. 
- subhASh chandra bose, a flawed urdu-islamophile, who nonetheless was a valuable agent in finally driving the british away by convincing them that the Indian army could not be relied upon to be loyal at a time when its own army wanted to disband \[[Ambedkar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO3wtmkuZT0&sns=tw)\].
- rAmAnanda-tIrtha, who galvanized hyderabad hindus against the nizAm \[W\].
- vishveshvarayya, the unfortunately anglicized engineer from maisuuru, builder of large public works in nAsik, hyderAbAd, maisuuru. Later diivaan of the maisuuru raaja \[[YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1LbPgeTekw)\]. Led a very disciplined 100+ year life, continued to be surprisingly spry.
    - spoke better gujarAti & marAThi than kannaDa and telugu! The man in many ways was a japanese (minus the geopolitical and spiritual genius) among us Indians.
    - He could not correctly grasp the low quality of our human resources and our existential struggle even as he repeatedly expressed disappointment about our pauruSha and focus on conservative brAhma.
- Devanahalli Venkataramanayya Gundappa (1887-1975) - a journalist, poet, sensitive rasika of many art-forms and people, philosopher, institution builder, social commentator, social worker, and activist. Consulted with major divAn-s of mysUru state - including vishveshvarayya. Misled initially to favor dumbocracy, realized his mistake only later.

This had a strong effect and many traditional Hindus now switched over to his side. He then demolished the most recalcitrant traditional astronomers in a sadas of brāhmaṇa-s of the Dramiḍa country. Seeing this the Śaṃkara maṭha sent out a circular stating that the Vedic ritualists Venkateshvara Dikshita and Sundaresha Shrautin were correct in adopting modern theory and techniques for their rituals.

Where there are heroes, villains are no surprise. Many were self-professed ghAzis (mujAhids intent on jihAd). Others power hungry people who pursued personal ambition at the cost of higher ideals.

A true exemplar of "kAshmIriyat".  

- Ghiyasuddin Al Damaghani, sultan of madurai, whose depravity is described by Ibn Batuta \[[AS16](https://agentsaffron.wordpress.com/2016/05/14/the-saviors-of-dharma-in-south-india-part-1/)\].
