title: Violence हिंसा
---
  

Violence, moderated by social and legal concerns, is allowed and practiced by hindu-s.

### Non-violence (ahimsA) and Violence

- The veda-s exhort non-violence (ahimsA), in general, as far as possible.
    - Vegetarianism is considered a great ideal.
        - "Manu Smriti (5.53) says that one who renounces consumption of eating attains spiritual benefit equal to that attained after conducting 100 Ashwamedha Yajnas." \[[NG15](http://www.newsgram.com/beef-controversy-yajna-madhuparka-and-the-use-of-beef/)\]
        - bhAgavata says abstinence from meat, liquor and sex is good ( 11.5.11 [Ar](https://archive.org/stream/SrimadBhagavatamCanto11withMultipleSanskritCommentaries/sb_canto_11#page/n235/mode/2up)).
    - But meat eating is not prohibited entirely.
        - pa.nca pa.nca nakhaa bhakSyaa brahma kSatreNa raaghava | shalyakaH shvaavidho godhaa shashaH kuurmaH ca pa.ncamaH || 4-17-39 "Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s. \[rAmAyaNa 4-17-39\]
        - suraaghaTasahasreNa maamsabhuutodanena cha | yakshye tvaam prayataa devi puriim punarupaagataa || 2-52-89 \[[FB](https://www.facebook.com/aditi.banerjee.3576/posts/10153393613443878?comment_id=10153394483698878&reply_comment_id=10153395312833878&notif_t=mentions_comment)\]
- This rule is overridden by other special rules which \*require\* violence and even non-vegetarianism.
    
    - Complete non-violence is impossible. Given that, it is better to embrace "appropriate" violence. Eg: Arjuna's advice to YudhiShThira in mahAbhArata here [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/the-lesson-of-arjuna/).
    - Protecting the good and punishing the bad requires violence, of course.
    - Permitted and required animal sacrifices:  
      - pashuyAga-s
          - kapinjala-adhikaraNa of mImAmsa-shAstra is a classic illustration (where the question of how many kapinjala birds are to be sacrificed is considered).
          - Certain compulsory पशुयाग-s (usually goat sacrifices) are required of agnihotri-s Eg: निरूढपशुबन्धः. \[Note: Optional cow and horse sacrifice exist, but are barred by the dharma-shAstra-s in the kali-yuga.\] Recent examples - [DH](http://www.deccanherald.com/content/544227/brahmins-hold-yaga-sacrifice-goats.html)16.
          - gavAlambha / cow sacrifice is also referred to in the manu-smRti, and others (eg: as part of madhuparka). Reference sample below.
    - Vedic Human Sacrifice
        - puruSha-medha
            - "Srauta sutras and even brahmanas mention that men are not killed in purushamedha"\[[TW17](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/849800893201612800)\]
            - "But maybe in pre samhita yajnas and para-vaidika traditions may have continued it".
                - "puruSha-medha rite the rival king was captured and brought as a prisoner by the sacrificing king. The rite lasted a whole year. At the end of it he was smothered and sacrificed with the deployment of the puruSha sUkta. Along with him, his animals may also be sacrificed and immolated as offerings." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/08/11/vedic-human-sacrifice/)\].
        - Collection of a skull for chayana during a yAga, described [here](../violence/), could involve killing.
        - (Almost) sacrifice of Śunaśśepha by ambarISha.
        - shunaskarNa+agniShToma where the yajamAna/patnI sacrifice themselves
    - Substitutions are endorsed in specific cases
        - "in the varuNapraghAsa, piSTarUpakas of sheep and ram are offered to the marut devas (the praghAsas)".
    
    - The emotional benefits of animal sacrifice are many.
        - At the end of an elaborate animal sacrifice, the many participants experience a great feeling of peace, at the cosmic order having been restored. \[[DrdakFB15](https://www.facebook.com/maureen.drdak/posts/10153588415369088)\]
        - They get to ingest the rare serving of nutritious animal meat. Rest of the time, the diet used to be mostly ovo-lacto-vegetarian. (This is true even in the Mediterranean region, where the word "carnival" implied the consumption of carne/ flesh.)
        - The special emotional benefits of such animal sacrifices probably involve maintaining the virility and a certain ruthlessness required of the guardians of our society.
    - Other justification
        - "The sacrifice of animals in Yajnas, etc. is not considered an injury because the animals derive great benefit out of it. The ritual helps them to attain heaven or get higher birth in the future (Manu Smriti 5.40, 41). ... Even if one were to reject these spiritual benefits as metaphors and superstitions, even then it is easy to see that conducting Yajnas are not contradictory to practicing Ahimsa. Ahimsa is an ideal, but except for renunciates, no person even nears ninety percent adherence to it." \[[NG15](http://www.newsgram.com/beef-controversy-yajna-madhuparka-and-the-use-of-beef/)\]
    - Later opposition to animal sacrifice
        - Story of uparichara vasu falling from heaven for siding with the deities on animal sacrifice \[[Mbh 12.37](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12c037.htm), [Mbh 14.91](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m14/m14091.htm)\].
        - "Although animal sacrifices were prevalent in the Vedic period, there were already some attempts to reduce this. They came up with the idea that instead of killing an animal, one could offer heartfelt praise to the gods or a fuel-stick or cooked food (see RVS 8.19.5 and 8.24.20 for example). In later times, they even developed an ingenious theory that a person who eats meat will—in his next birth—become the meat eaten by that animal (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.6.1.3)." \[[SG15](http://indiafacts.org/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/)\]
- Specially protected animals: cow, horse, man ...
    - Optional cow and horse sacrifice exist, but are barred by the dharma-shAstra-s in the kali-yuga.
    - It came to be a prime duty of the king to protect cows from slaughter in his domain.
        - (गोब्राह्मणेभ्यश् शुभमस्तु नित्यम् …)
        - Shivaji cut off hands of cow killers, gangAdevI decries wanton cow slaughter by the mlecCha-s.
        - keraLa
            - Duarte Barbosa, a 16th century Portuguese writer : “The King then asks him if he will maintain the customs and rules of the other Nayres (Nairs), and he and his kinsmen respond ‘ Yes.’ Then the King commands him to gird on his right side a sword with a red sheath, and when it is girt on he causes him to approach near to himself and la, his right hand on his head, saying therewith certain words which none may hear, seemingly a prayer, and then embraces him saying ‘ Paje Gubrantarca, that is to say ‘ Protect cows and Bramenes (Brahmins)” \[[GB](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=cAgkDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT40)\]
            - A similar oath was made by Samuthiris or Zamorins, the Nair kings of Calicut before their royal coronation “At Yagneswaram he is met by Vemaneheri Namputiri,  a descendant of Melattur Agnihotri. The Eralped (Zamorin) gives him an ola (text), promising to protect Brahmins, temples and cows.” \[[Ar](https://archive.org/details/TheZamorinsOfCalicut)\]
            - It is interesting to note that Aithihyamala, a 19th century work detailing many folklore and legends of Kerala also records an incident in which the famous 18th century Raja of Cochin, Rama Varma Shaktan Thampuran executed a Muslim who had killed a cow.  The Raja also refused to observe Shivaratri vrata since the Muslim had killed the cow on that day.
    - The context of hindu-muslim conflict (with the latter using cow slaughter to stick it to the hindus - Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi,  Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer  \[[NG15-B](http://www.newsgram.com/beef-controversy-origins-of-beef-consumption-in-india/)\]) makes cow protection a particularly important issue.
        - Visceral reactions are an essential expression of a strong Hindu cultural immune system. The easier it is to identify the barbarian, the better the chances of survival of this very exalted "sanAtana" dharma.
    - The context of hindu-european conflict
        - Dharampal writes in his book “The British Origin of Cow-Slaughter in India”: “‘It can be reasonably assumed that there was very little cow killing after about 1700 AD since the domination of Islam waned and converts to Islam did not take to eating of cow flesh.”
        - "This steep increase in the British population (especially of those in the military) in India resulted in many fold increase in cow-slaughtering and beef consumption. Lodha report notes that, in some places, the increase was as high as fourfold. The report further notes that as against 20,000 cows per year that were killed during Islamic rule, around 30,000 cows were killed every year at the height of the British period."  \[[NG15-B](http://www.newsgram.com/beef-controversy-origins-of-beef-consumption-in-india/)\]
    - Current cow protection efforts
        - Comfortable sanctuaries for cows (go-shAlA)
            - examples - [pANDuranga16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Us1oGMSzQ&app=desktop).
    - Dalit communities and beef
        - "A recent mapping of the food habits of Dalit communities published by Swarajya Magazine clearly shows that though 80% of the Dalit communities are meat eaters, they discourage beef." \[[NG15-B](http://www.newsgram.com/beef-controversy-origins-of-beef-consumption-in-india/)\]
    - Comparison with similar cultures
        - Iran
            - "The Zoroastrian religion forbids cow flesh for consumption. The cow also figures symbolically in several aspects of that religion, and cow urine is drunk at the Navjote sacrament. It is another matter that Westernized Anglophile Parsis have ignored the dietary laws among many other things. ... even until recently, cows were not a part of regular diet in Iran. It was during Westernization under the Qajar dynasty that the Brits & French introduced beef eating big time (which is now widespread in Iran). That shift was a traumatic cultural change, especially in the countryside. Watch the Persian movie "Gaav" (Cow) \[[YT1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9gthjarCho)\], which depicts the attachment an Irani peasant has for his cow, and how the new beef industry sponsored cattle mafia snatch his kine from him, causing him to have a nervous breakdown. Khomeini, who was initially against film as a medium was convinced to allow the film industry to continue to operate after he watched that movie." \[[AG12](http://authenticgathazoroastrianism.org/2012/03/05/zoroastrian-dietary-laws-animal-friendship-and-stewardship/)\]
        - Pakistan's ban on female animal slaughter since 1963 - reinvigorated even in 2015 - [DA15](http://www.dawn.com/news/1199794).
        - Among the masai, cattle is slaughtered only in times of great need (eg - famine). \[[MAL](http://www.bluegecko.org/kenya/tribes/maasai/livestock.htm)\]
        - Japan
            - Emperor Shomu (8th ce) had banned cow and horse slaughter. This was one of the justifications used by Toyotomi Hideyoshi to expel Jesuits. For centuries, it was taboo in Japan to kill cows (and more broadly other domestic animals) - wild game was allowed. \[[B](http://agrarianstudies.macmillan.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/colloqpapers/18botsman.pdf)\]
            - "Tsunayoshi’s “Laws of Compassion” are most closely associated with the protection of dogs, but as Tsukamoto points out, the laws he enacted regarding the abandonment of sick cattle and horses were, in fact, both stricter and further reaching." \[[B](http://agrarianstudies.macmillan.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/colloqpapers/18botsman.pdf)\]
            - Yet, almost as soon as the new “treaty port” of Kobe was opened to Western settlement in 1868, it began to develop a reputation for its meat. The Tokugawa continued this ban. \[[B](http://agrarianstudies.macmillan.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/colloqpapers/18botsman.pdf)\]
- Some animal and human sacrifice is not prescribed in the veda-s, but practiced nonetheless by some hindu-s (and rejected by others).
    - Human sacrifice:
        - For better harvest (Assam 2015) [here](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/india-man-beheaded-suspected-sacrifice-better-harvest-1504156).
        - For spiritual and other reasons : \[[TC](http://i.imgur.com/Y3wLB0B.png)\].
        - Comparison:
            - Guru Gobind Singh famously called for human sacrifice volunteers, the panj pyare.
            - among the unmatta-s, abrAham almost sacrificed issac.
    - For durga and profit
        - Gadhimai festival in nepal ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadhimai_festival)).
    - Apologetics
        - True to the word "carnival", many hindu families traditionally eat meat only after festivals. Hence, per capita meat consumption is very low compared to, say, USA ([fusa](http://farmusa.org/statistics11.html), [img](http://i.imgur.com/k6KT3cy.jpg)).
    - Honoring a guest:
        - "Madhuparka is the practice of offering honey to honour a distinguished guest. According to Yājñavalkyasmṛti 1.110, six kinds of people are offered madhuparka – a priest (ṛtvik), a teacher (ācārya), bridegroom, king, graduate (snātaka), and someone dear to the host. The Baudhāyana Gṛhyasūtra 1.2.65 adds ‘guest’ (atithi) to this list. As part of madhuparka, honey, curds, ghee, water, and grains were offered while meat was optional (See Āśvalāyāna Gṛhyasūtra 1.22.5-26 for more details)."
- Suicide
    - prAyopaveshaNa - starving oneself.
    - Burning oneself on a pire as a paschAt-tApa/ prAyashchita. The pAla king, the tale of the maNDana.
    - sallekhana among jains.
    - garuDa heroes following their kings in South India \[[IM](http://i.imgur.com/LcJGXVh.png)\].
    - Following the husband by satI-s (../details [here](women/)). 
- ALso, hinduism is not for good people alone.
    - rAvaNa was also reputed to be a shiva-devotee (same with several other rAkShasa-s).
    - Yogi-s and ascetics did serve as warriors and mercenaries.
        - "European travelers of the period frequently describe yogis who are “skilled cut-throats” and professional killers. “Some of them carry a stick with a ring of iron at the base,” wrote Ludovico di Varthema of Bologna in 1508. “Others carry certain iron diskes which cut all round like razors, and they throw these with a sling when they wish to injure any person.” A century later the French jewel merchant Jean Baptiste Tavernier was describing large bodies of holy men on the march, “well armed, the majority with bows and arrows, some with muskets, and the remainder with short pikes.” By the Maratha wars of the early nineteenth century, the Anglo-Indian mercenary James Skinner was fighting alongside “10 thousand Gossains called Naggas with Rockets, and about 150 pieces of cannon.”" - [WD14](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/mar/06/under-spell-yoga/)
        - Mahadji Shinde, a rival leader of the time, was convinced that Anupgiri had attacked him with a painful case of boils through his “magical arts.” Nor was Anupgiri necessarily a champion of Hindu interests: “Far from thinking of themselves as the last line of defense against foreign invaders, armed ascetics in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth century served any and all paymasters,” writes Pinch. Though he sometimes fought with the Hindu Marathas, at other times Anupgiri worked for the Mughal emperor. - [WD14](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/mar/06/under-spell-yoga/)

## References to animal sacrifice

- References to cow sacrifices in veda-s
    - "In the Rigveda Saṃhitā, we see that our ancients cooked the flesh of oxen and offered it to the gods, especially Indra (see RVS 10.86.14 or 10.27.2, for example). Horses, bulls, oxen, barren cows, and rams were sacrificed for Agni (RVS 10.91.14). Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.1.2.21 says that sage Yājñavalkya would eat the meat of cows and oxen, provided it was tender. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.18 says that if a couple wants to beget a son who will grow up to be a great scholar, they have to eat rice cooked with beef, along with ghee. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.7.1.3 goes on to say that meat is the best kind of food!" ... In RVS 8.43.11, Agni is hailed as one whose food is the ox and the barren cow. Often in the Rigveda Saṃhitā (see 1.164.27, 1.164.40, 4.1.6, and 5.83.8, for example), the cow is called aghnyā, ‘one who doesn’t deserve to be killed.’ Therefore, it seems that only barren cows were killed. How else do we account for the lavish praise showered on cows (RVS 6.23.1-8 and 8.101.15-16)? One verse (RVS 8.101.16), which hails the cow as devī, ‘goddess.’" [SG15](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/).
    - Bull to indra (10-28 -3 - unchecked)
- References to animal sacrifice in other ancient works
    - "Brahma Sūtra (3.1.25) says that the scriptures don’t have a problem with killing animals for a specified ritual. Even the Manusmṛti, a text that is rather partial to vegetarianism, says that meat-eating is fine under specific circumstances like during a calamity or as part of a ritual (MS 5.27, 5.32)."[SG15](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/).
- References in classical poetry
    - "In the Mahābhārata (Droṇa Parva / Book 3, Chapter 199), sage Mārkāṇḍeya tells Yudhiṣṭhira the story of a hunter and a priest. When the priest accuses the hunter of violence, the latter narrates the story of King Rantideva: “In Rantideva’s kitchen, two thousand animals were killed every day as were two thousand cows. Rantideva became famous because he fed meat to all his people."[SG15](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/).
    - " Kālidāsa (5th century CE) says in Meghadūta 1.45 that River Charmanvati (modern-day Chambal) arose from the glory of King Rantideva who sacrificed thousands of cows. Mallinātha (13th century CE) says in his commentary on the Meghadūta that Charmanvati originated with the constant washing of cow hide and the flowing of the blood of cows."[SG15](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/).

## A note on ethics:
- Violence (alongside empathy) is inherent in our nature. "One of the defining aspects of life is biological conflict: it can be established that life as we know it would not exist without biological conflicts: existence is literally: "red in tooth and claw". Hence, killing and getting killed are part of life& there is no way out of it. Animal life for most part depends on eating other organisms be they plants, other animals or any other lineage of organism. In course of evolution herbivores evolve into carnivores and herbivores from carnivores. We can say that the common ancestor hominid apes included meat in their diet and hunted. The evidence suggests that meat is valued by hominids as a special diet beyond their routine plant-derived fare -- high in nutrients. Hence, with the origin of religion meat was a “costly” offering to the gods. Given this prior, I don’t see animal sacrifices as easily dying out in a natural religion. That said I do think kindness and empathy are generally virtues. However, being paralyzed by virtue is not good for a being or a group either: Enemies have to be killed if you don’t want to be killed. You have to kill if you need to feed yourself. Hence, my personal opinion is that killing “within reasonable limits” is always going to be there and need not be a cause for condemnation. Where those limits are certainly open for debate and discussion and have changed in course of the evolution of H tradition."- [MT18](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1052040637531467776)
- "Then there are considerations relating to public health. Eating other animals which are closer to us phylogenetically are likely to transmit pathogens and parasites.Having blood and carcasses lying around could be a public health concern irrespective of the pathogens borne by the consumed animals. Hence, this calls for caution and regulation in non-vegetarian rituals."- [MT18](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1052040637531467776)
- A person who does not condemn "halal butcherings, Thanksgiving slaughter, western slaughterhouses, etc., and the serving of meat in restaurants" does not have the moral authority to condemn animal sacrifice. \[US Slaughter statistics [here](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/resources/research/stats_slaughter_totals.html).\]
- The separation of spiritual and mundane does not exist for hindu-s; and there is no fundamental reason why murder (when it has to be committed) should not be enmeshed within spirituality and ritual.
- Vegetarianism requires less resources, and is better for the planet. Veganism is even less harmful. \[PETA [article](http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/meat-wastes-natural-resources/)\]
