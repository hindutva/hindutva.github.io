title: Women स्त्रीः
---
## Generalia

\[Incomplete\]  

- Consider shatAvadhAnI-gaNesha's [commentary on the role of women](../http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmlvavD3LSg) in ancient India (esp. compared with contempraneous societies elsewhere). Also see examples [here](../history/heroes/).  
    
- Womanhood as a lower status birth (hindu society was patriarchal, as in other contemporary societies)  
    - At a ritual and social (rather than family) level, there is no doubt that status of women was lower.  
        - women and shUdra-s are considered by some, barring exempt pUja-s, to be ineligible for saying paurANika mantra-s - japa-s and homa-s are to be conducted through a brAhmaNa \[[DS78](http://imgur.com/a/9bPwr)\].  Agama-s widen this adhikAra.
    - the bhagavadgItA pApayoni (lowly birth / birth resulting \[ultimately\] from paapa-s/ sins) trope
        - Restricted reference to strI shUdra vaishya pApayonis in contrast with brAhmaNas and rAjarShi-s is for rhetorical effect when talking to kShatriya arjuna. \[[YT](https://youtu.be/2XKPJXOvZ_g?t=944)\]
        - taittIriya-shAkhA says: "even women with superior knowledge are in effect males, and vice versa." \[[YT](https://youtu.be/2XKPJXOvZ_g?t=1021)\].
        - madhva did not say that all strI-s are pApa-yonis - shankara did, as we see below - rAmAnuja did. \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/sB8uCPm.png)\] Though madhva did not comment on the shloka in question, the mAdhva tradition \[[nAgendrAchAryaYT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7_fpvtpt90)\] seems to be clear who pApayoni-s are - unfortunate beings who suffer daily - for example those being born in the wrong gendered body.  
            
        - The shloka and commentary by rAmAnuja more or less literally states: "strI-s, shUdras and vaishyas, even (if they are) pApayoni-s can reach me". Some take it to mean that all strI-s, shUdra-s and vaishya-s are pApayoni-s. (But note: ANDAl the incarnation of lakShmI in rAmAnuja's tradition was a woman.) \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/sB8uCPm.png)\]
        - The late Dr. N.S. Anantharangachar commenting on rAmAnuja's shrIbhAShya takes it to mean that all strI-s are refererred to as pApayoni-s \[[IMG1](http://imgur.com/a/Bg576) [IMG2](https://i.imgur.com/9NUYa1c.jpg) [IMG3](https://i.imgur.com/Da21zjB.jpg) \]. (This is supported by gItArthasangraha(raxA) of vedAnta-deshika. \[Anantharangachar's son: [YT](https://youtu.be/2XKPJXOvZ_g?t=697)\])
- Right to property? Is woman property to be "given" away or sold during marriage?
    - shabarasvAmin answering this misassertion over 1.5k years ago \[[6.1.13e](https://archive.org/stream/ShabaraBhasyaTrByGanganathJha/Shabara%20Bhasya%20tr%20by%20Ganganath%20Jha%20Vol%202#page/n289/mode/2up), [TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/864525895784169475)\].
- The shAstra-s catered to parents who yearned for girls (Apastamba - [IMG](http://imgur.com/EY8uTXbs)) and scholarly girls (बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद्(शुक्लयजुर्वेद)-  अथ य इच्छेद् दुहिता मे पण्डिता जायेत सर्वमायुरियादिति तिलौदनं पाचयित्वा.).
- Marriage, divorce - see [here](../aashrama/).

- Female foeticide.
    - Foeticide is a grave sin according to hindu-shAstra-s. Yet, in violation of this, people have killed female foetuses in the past.
    - There has been tradition based attempts to address this problem: example [girl-child-11-trees-village](http://www.folomojo.com/indias-other-daughters/).
- Access to education and scholarship
    - rAjashekhara clearly says in Kavyamimamsa 10th chapter:
        - "पुरुषवद्योषितोऽपि कवीभवेयुः । संस्कारो ह्यात्मनि समवैति, न स्त्रैणं वा पौरुषं वा विभागमपेक्षते । श्रूयन्ते दृश्यन्ते च राजपुत्र्यो महामात्रदुहितरो गणिकाः कौतुकिभार्याश्च शास्त्रप्रहतबुद्धयः कवयश्च ।"
        - Commentary: "यथा पुरुषास्तथा योषितोऽपि स्त्रियोऽपि कवीभवेयुः काव्यकर्त्र्यः स्युः । सहेतुकं विवेचयति संस्कार इति । कवित्वं संस्कारविशेषजन्यम् । संस्कारश्च आत्मनि समवैति समवायसम्बन्धेन वर्त्तते न स्रियाः शरीरे वर्त्तते । अतश्च अयं स्त्रीत्वावच्छिन्नः अयं पुरुषावच्छिन्न आत्मा इत्येवं रूपेण स्त्रिया आगतं स्त्रैणं पुरुषादागतं पौरुषं विभागं नापेक्षते । दृष्टान्तेन उपपादयति \- श्रूयन्त इति । श्रूयन्ते कर्णाभ्यामिति शेषः । नहि श्रवणमात्रे सत्यता इत्यतो दार्ढ्यायोच्यते \- दृश्यते चक्षुर्भ्यामिति शेषः । राज्ञां सुताः । महामात्राणाममात्यसचिवादिकानां कन्यकाः । गणिकाः वेश्याः कौतुकिनां नटानामैन्द्रजालिकानां वा भार्याः अथवा कौतिकिन्यो भार्याश्च । शास्त्रेषु प्रहताः क्षुण्णाः अथवा शास्त्रद्वारा प्रहताः सम्मार्जिता उभयथापि निर्मला इत्यर्थः बुद्धयो यासां ताः शास्त्रप्रहतबुद्धयः । अथ च कवयः कवयित्र्यः ॥  
            "
    - Comparitively higher opportunities for unmarried and married women.
        - Eg: Vijayanagara poetess princess author of madhurAvijayam, vijjikA the dark skinned 7th century karNATa poetess.
- Rape
    - Arguable reference to wife beating and rape in bRhadAraNyaka : [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/M699DZ6.jpg). ( षष्ठोऽध्यायः । चतुर्थं ब्राह्मणम् । मन्त्रः ७)
        - [FB15](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=990115107700335&set=p.990115107700335&type=1).
        - shankara considers such to be smRtyanuvAdinI, as representing smArta, rather than shrauta karma-s. Example: 6.3.1 commentary (- [http://i.imgur.com/GmoWeUa.png](http://i.imgur.com/GmoWeUa.png) । अनुवादोऽत्र - [http://i.imgur.com/2boHAYb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2boHAYb.jpg) ।). smRti-s according to some dharmashAstra commentators have less authority than shruti.
        - Unsatisfactory excuses: Some authorities interpret it as encoding a secret (eg: होळेनरसीपुरवासिनः परमपूज्याः श्री श्री सच्चिदानन्देन्द्रसरस्वतीपरमहंसाः IMG[1](http://i.imgur.com/gZbPyuA.jpg)) \- so it should not be taken literally.
        - Of course, it is easy to regard them as one of the ancient recommendations which need to be given up since the society so hates them (../as explained [here](dharma-fluid/)).
        - वेदेषु नैकानि सन्ति दारुणानि कर्माणि यानि कलिवर्ज्यानीति कथ्यन्ते सगर्हणम् पश्चात्तनस्मृतिकारैः। यथा गवालम्भः, नियोगः, कान्याक्रयणम् … । तेष्व् एतदपीति मे मतिः।
    - Some extrapolated the horrendous Nirbhaya rape to suggest that Indian (and by extension Hindu) civilization is particularly horrible for women. 
        - Needless to say, no hindu holy man/ text says: "rape is punishment for going out late."
        - Responses: [petty-crime-reportage](https://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/is-delhi-really-that-dangerous-jenny-dave-prager/), [female-successes](http://indiafacts.co.in/i-too-am-indias-daughter/), [comparison-to-west](http://indiafacts.co.in/examining-the-wests-culture-of-rape/), [stupid-western-lawmen](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/12/13-year-old-s-rape-case-dismissed-because-her-body-is-well-developed.html).

  

## Access to lore and ritual

- Access is, of course, graded. This is a consequence of the allowance for exclusivism in the hindu way (../see[here](../self-cultivation/communal-support/exclusivity/)).
- Neo-Traditional female brAhmaNI ritual specialists - [IMG](https://imgur.com/qBfxxQI).
- Ritual purity and mestural cycles
    - A mensturating woman is considered ritually impure for most purposes.
        - This is atleast as old as Apastamba shrauta sUtra \[[IMG](https://i.imgur.com/6MS3I5u.jpg)\].
    - yAga-dIxa overcomes this \[[IMG](https://i.imgur.com/6MS3I5u.jpg)\].

### Access to veda-s 
- \[Discussions - [BVP](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/0n41vcuW9E0/6vLNNRViDQAJ)\]
- Not uncommon access for brahmavAdinI-s in texts.
    - हारितः \- "तत्र ब्रह्मवादिनीनाम् उपनयनम्, अग्नीन्धनम् वेदाध्ययनं स्वगृहे च भिक्षाचर्येति।"
    - Women got the upanayana initiation (as a symbolism before marriage or as a serious initiation depending on the case) well into the gRhya-sUtra and early dharma-shAstra ages (काणे-विचार-सारो [ऽत्र](https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfDharmasastraVol.IIPartIPandurangVamanKane/History%20Of%20Dharmasastra%20-%20Vol.%20II%20Part%20I%20-%20Pandurang%20Vaman%20Kane#page/n345/mode/2up)।)
    - "पुरा कल्पेषु नारीणां मौञ्जीबन्धनमिष्यते । अध्यापनं च वेदानां सावित्रीवचनं तथा ॥"
- Woman wearing yajnopavIta [TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/709601817584340992).
    - "इदानीमप्यौत्कल्यदेशे विवाहकाले कन्या धारयत्येव।  चतुर्थीकर्म पर्यन्तम्।  स्वयमेव दृष्टम्मया।"
- Patanjali gives some examples in स्त्रीप्रत्ययप्रकरणम्--
    - काशकृत्स्निना प्रोक्ता मीमांसा  काशकृत्स्ना  \- that means काशकृत्स्ना was a Vedic scholar .
    - औदमेय्याः  छात्राः  औदमेयाः \- there were good and great women scholers .
- Other examples of requiring women to say vaidika mantra-s - kANe [here](https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfDharmasastraVol.IIPartIPandurangVamanKane/History%20Of%20Dharmasastra%20-%20Vol.%20II%20Part%20I%20-%20Pandurang%20Vaman%20Kane#page/n417/mode/2up).
- There are many examples of female deities wearing yajJNopavIta - but what applies to the Gods don't apply to us :-)
- Apastamba says - पाणिग्रहाणात् सहत्वं कर्मसु पुण्यफलेषु च ।
    

### Professional dimorphism

- Female participation in the army.
    - In the era of large armies/ warring class: Sparing participation makes great sense given the importance of wombs. \[[IMG](http://i.imgsafe.org/bb34718889.jpg), \]
        - "Loss of females is a real loss of fitness for the social group, while loss of even a fraction of the males will not change seriously change fitness as long as the number of females are intact. Thus, inter-group conflict is likely to eventually evolve a strong bias towards male only participation, which will be further exacerbated in favor of males when there is strong sexual dimorphism in mean size, speed and strength between the two sexes. ... in mammals, the females bearing small number of live young after prolonged gestation and a clear sexual dimorphism in mean size means soldier-formation will be male-biased. However, in insects of the cockroach clade, wherein termites evolved, the sexual dimorphism generally manifests in the form of bigger females. Thus, the soldier caste in termites shows a clear bias towards females. Similarly, the gene dosage from diploidy, underlying size dimorphism, and relationship bias from haplo-diploidy (sisters being more related than brothers) makes the soldier caste of hymenopterans predominantly female only. There are only rare exceptions where both sexes might participate in soldiering like embryonic soldiers of the the encyrtid wasp Copidosoma and we can explain that." \[[MT17](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/of-lives-of-men-of-times-of-men-iii/)\]
    - Females are weaker in general than men.
    - Mixed combat units have been shown to be less effective.
- यथा सैन्ये पुंभूयिष्ठता सार्थका, तथैव वैदुष्ये ऽपीति तैरेव र्पायेण कारणैस् स्यान्ननु? (नाम गर्भाणाम् महार्हत्वात्, पुंसाम् अधिकात् साहसाच्च स्वाभाविकात्)।

#### Domains of female dominance

- deva-dAsI-s. Temple dancers with sexual freedom, who produced proud cultural luminaries like singer MS [Subbulakshmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subbulakshmi) and [dancer bAlasarasvatI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balasaraswati).
    
    - The old status of deva-dAsI-s is generally not comparable to the modern yellamma cult.
