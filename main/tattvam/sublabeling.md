### Comparison with classical darshanas (views of the "suchness")

There is exactly one reality, however there are many mata-s (opinions) and darshana-s (views) about it. Any two darshanas agree in some matters, and disagree on others. In comparing these views (expressed above) with classical darshana-s:

- I have to reject:
    - crass materialism (characteristic of some [chArvAka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charvaka)s/ lOkAyatas), which mirrors modern reactionary atheism
    - excessive contempt for the veda-s (some bauddha-s, sIkhs, jaina-s)
    - excessive non-violent tendencies, or focus on asceticism (jaina-s, pAtanjala-yogins)
- An evaluation of various philosophies:
    - The supremely analytical [vaishEShika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisheshika)s of yore, whose system (despite not needing a creator God other than the impersonal "sound"/ energy of the praNava) upheld the [vEda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veda)s as illuminators of dharma (not vice-versa), and who considered [karman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma) to be ultimately based on simple physical force acting on paramANus (atoms), are close.
    - [pUrva-mImAmsa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mim%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81). \[[AL06](http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2006-January/015679.html), [Idx](http://www.mimamsa.org/articles/brief_introduction.html)\]
        - Likes:
            - their regard for the "eternal" veda-s fits in nicely with viewing them as dharma-manuals for human beings to abide by Rta (the divine order). they reconcile respectability of the smRti-s as being derived from lost veda-s.
            - their arthavAda concept, which reduces the tales the ("eternal") veda-s spin (and unrealistic injunctions) to praises or condemnation of dhArmika action. This is important and more widely applicable. (I remember someone telling me that PV Kane said that svarga is just an imaginary place as far as shabara is concerned. Haven't figured out where. If anyone knows please tell.)
            - they appeal to unconscious apurva-s (rather than Ishvara) to deliver fruits of dhArmika actions (esp. yajJNa). since it does not need a creator God.
        - Dislikes
            - Text centrism
            - Low emphasis placed on feeling. (Though the notion of Rta is in the background.) Eg. mantra-s said without knowing meaning are effective.
    - Generic vEdAnta I admire- particularly the non-ascetic karmayOga part (योगः कर्मसु कौशलं॥, [sAttvika tyAga](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sattvika_tyaga) of karmas).
    - shaiva-siddhAnta
        - As presented by abhinavagupta ([LJ14](https://yogainternational.com/article/view/tantra-and-the-teachings-of-abhinavagupta)):
            
    - I like aspects of tAntrika bauddha practice (vajrayAna), with its vedic/ purANic influence, rich artistic rituals and emphasis on compassion.
    - Religious humanism: an integration of humanist ethical philosophy with religious rituals and beliefs that center on human needs, interests, and abilities.
        - I admire parts of it, but dislike cases where it deifies humanity (and not the rest of the universe).
            - On religious atheism, [the Positivist church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_of_Humanity) and the deification of humanity.
    - Beyond all, I admire the [AlankArika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_aesthetics)-s (aestheticians); who reveled in poetry and the arts; and attempted to understand and articulate life as an aesthetic experience. What they believed beyond this, due to their cultural context, in concepts such as brahmAnanda, jagadAnanda, vedAnta etc.., is not relevant to me. (This is a view shared by eminent modern classical aestheticians such as M hiryaNNa and shatAvadhAnI gaNesh.)

All said and done, I only say that "Art can replace religion in this age, one is alive and not a machine as long as one is full of good feelings. Only an artistic mind can be vitally alive".

### Labeling.

- In English, Hindu Humanism (as in [Religious Humanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_humanism)) will do.
- "Spirituality", if it means "a deep emotional connection with nature/ universe", is apt too.
- "Modern orthodoxy", analogous to what is described [here](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/08/31/modern-orthodoxy-as-a-glue-between-the-ultra-orthodox-and-the-liberal-the-jewish-example/), is apt also.
- In saMskRta, considering similarities and differences described the above, the following will do: nava-vaishEShika (new vaishEShika), sahRdayavAdI.

With regards to distinctions such as "Astika/ nAstika", "dvaitin/ advaitin", "saguNa/ nirguNa", "only one Atman which is expressed differently in different bodies vs many Atman-s" etc..,  I pride myself for being a unqualified, generic (nirvishiShTa) hindu. Rather, speculation should be freely admitted where necessary; and the advaita / dvaita etc.. points of view (darshana-s) should be used and discarded as necessary, like therapy.

### Other practicing hindus with updated beliefs.

Many highly regarded, erudite and practicing hindu-s are/ have been quite happy to update their belief systems with modern scientific findings (eg: theory of evolution). They too do not find the concept of karma and rebirth to be central to the hindu tradition which they hold so dear.

- shatAvadhAnI gaNesh (source:[ his lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2ounFpr5CwJt1MHN2xB8aHe6ip06Olgm) on "Foundations of Indian Culture"), the great poet and avadhAna-artist, an advaita-vedAntin.
- The fine scholar M Hiriyanna, who famously said (I paraphrase): "Art can replace religion in this age of rationality and equality".
