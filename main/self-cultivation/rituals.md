## Benefits

The study and practice of hindu kalpa-s is quite \*addictive\* and (thankfully) useful - just as some other performance arts are. Even if you discount purported supernatural benefits, many hindu rituals (with their varied [mantra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra), [tantra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra), svara underpinnings) are incredibly well designed. Besides being inter-generational vehicles of culture, they form an effective path to self-cultivation (refinement of [buddhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhi), manas, ahaMkAra) when performed correctly with proper sentiment (esp: bhakti) and understanding.

The US army flag-hoisting ceremony and the Japanese tea ceremony are examples of very moving rituals in non-hindu contexts which may resonate with your past experience, gentle reader.

Even child development experts state: "Creating your own special rituals now, and faithfully repeating them throughout your child's life, will provide your child with a sense of security, stability, belonging, connectedness, and pride in his family." \[[BC](http://www.babycenter.com/0_family-rituals-why-they-matter-and-how-to-start-your-own_374.bc?scid=mbtw_toddler_post13m_3w&pe=MlVGbWE0aXwyMDE2MTEwOC00NQ..)\]

### Harmonization of groups

Rituals have acted to bring different groups together, to function harmoniously towards shared ideals. They can be used to bolster unity even in face of threats:

- Intra-group
    - Rituals evolve as costly, hard-to-fake signals of commitment to shared group identity and goals. -- Christine Legare
- Inter-group
    - Routinely temple and group festivals bring together all groups of a village harmoniously.
    - Sri Sendalankara Sampathkumara Ramanuja Jeeyar performed a Mahalakshmi Homam at the Pazhangallikkadu village dalit community under islamicization threat \[[HP2016](https://hinduexistence.org/2016/08/12/islamists-conversion-plot-foiled-in-tamil-nadu/)\].
    - ektA-yajJNa of saharanpur UP in the context of dalit vs others conflict \[[AV17](https://twitter.com/Parikramah/status/866881032129310721)\]

  

### Knowledge transmission

Rituals are important vehicles for transmitting knowledge and cultural values.

"A well-developed ritualist caste with a powerful oral tradition and specifically a grammatically tradition that allowed preservation of the language, especially in ritual, close to its old Indo-European state" probably explains the thriving of various branches Indo Aryan culture (../including Lithuanians \- see [here](../../paganology/europe/), Hindus, Iranians).

"The transmission of customs and conventions, linguistic or otherwise, from one generation to the next is never perfect. Over multiple generations, any sign, symbol, or picture that once conveyed meaning may become completely unrecognizable. This is a problem that was addressed by the semiotician Thomas Sebeok when, in the early 1980s, he was asked by the Office of Nuclear Waste Isolation to prepare a report on how best to encode a warning message on sites where nuclear waste had been buried. To ensure the safety of future generations, the message had to be interpretable for ten thousand years. He recommended extreme redundancy of encoding... But even all of this redundancy, he noted, might prove worthless in ten thousand years. he proposed, was to include a second “metamessage,” with a “plea and a warning” that every 250 years or so the information (including the “metamessage” itself) be re-encoded ... Still the possibility would exist that the people of the future would ignore the plea, or forget to comply, so as added insurance he suggests the creation of a sort of folklore, perpetuated through rituals and legends, that would promote the development of a superstition or taboo about the added responsibility of seeing to it that our behest, as embodied in the cumulative sequence of metamessages, is to be heeded ... Even if the “priesthood” should forget the original reason for its existence, it is hoped that whatever kind of entity it should evolve into would maintain some sort of authority and sense of responsibility toward passing on the folklore. ...  Even if the “priesthood” should forget the original reason for its existence...  
Meaning resides not in the symbol or the image or the language in which it is encoded but in the society that interprets it. New generations are born, societies change, and, with them, the interpretation of meaning. The best shot we had at getting our message across was to try to influence the society of the future—either by entreating it to adapt the encoding of the message to its times or by planting an aura of danger in a broad social tradition." \[In the Land of Invented Languages - [GB](https://books.google.com/books?id=3anWeY0G2moC&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=Thomas+Sebeok+when,+in+the+early+1980s,+he+was+asked+by+the+Office+of+Nuclear+Waste+Isolation+to+prepare+a+report&source=bl&ots=0_D0pUd30q&sig=t3CWrwtgQIRgS9WyOb_hH7hds7A&hl=sa&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwist8r3sZLMAhVQx2MKHX5kAQUQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=Thomas%20Sebeok%20when%2C%20in%20the%20early%201980s%2C%20he%20was%20asked%20by%20the%20Office%20of%20Nuclear%20Waste%20Isolation%20to%20prepare%20a%20report&f=false), [FB](https://www.facebook.com/suhas.mahesh/posts/10207652271119125)\]

### Engineering connection

Since ancient days hindu rituals have required and therefore encouraged mathematical and engineering knowledge. shulba-sUtra-s, precise construction of altars, yAga-shAlA-s and temples etc.. Together with it comes complex logistical management.

  

Contemporary examples:

- kumbha mela
- yAtrA kitchens
    - ISKCON [here](https://youtu.be/_jmf3ngMPvo?t=894).

### Supernatural effects?

See [magic page](../../tattvam/science-magic/).

## Ritual reality and ritual coherence
- "This is how our ritual spaces work and something I hope can be drilled into the heads of the judges who have no erudition about our religion. The deity’s nature (in Southern Agamika & tAntrika temples, this is based on the mantra-s installed in the deity’s icon/vigraha), location of deity’s shrine, nature of rituals done, type of priesthood, kind of food and flower offerings made to deity, nature of people who come to the temple, colors of garments worn by the deity, priests & devotees & many other factors all have to cohere with one another as far as possible. All these factors come together to create a coherent “ritual reality”, which is the ultimate fruit a sincere worshiper truly yearns for. The deity’s presence becomes fully manifest and becomes a source of blessings for the worshipers and their families. Different Agama-s and tantra-s have their own versions of the “ritual reality” or “ritual universe” they are asking the priests and others to enact on this earth." {[GA18](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2018/07/22/a-short-discussion-on-pertinent-issues-presented-by-the-sabarimala-matter/)}

- "Some idiot Hindus stated that the argument that shrI dharmashAstA in his form as ayyappa is observing naiSThika brahmacharya is not a sensible one as it suggests that ayyappa is “unable to see his women devotees in the 10-50 age group as sisters or mothers”. ... Our deities have transcendental and most subtle bodies. They do not “eat offerings” or “observe brahmacaryam” in the same way mortals would be seen in our mundane level of reality. Rituals and myths operate at a higher level of reality. What is the significance of this? ... All these factors come together to create a coherent “ritual reality”, which is the ultimate fruit a sincere worshiper truly yearns for. The deity’s presence becomes fully manifest and becomes a source of blessings for the worshipers and their families."  {[GA18](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2018/07/22/a-short-discussion-on-pertinent-issues-presented-by-the-sabarimala-matter/)}


### Domain of the sacred and taboos

Even though, fundamentally, there is no sacred vs profane distinction in the hindu POV in terms of restriction of applicability of concepts such as "dharma" and "brahman", there is such distinction in the world of practice (a book should not be stepped on, though one can step on a shoe). Hindus are naturally emotionally affected by attacks or regard to these sacred entities. They serve to preserve some biases useful in the pursuit of dharma, artha and kaama.

- "While H dharma has much diversity of praxis within it of course there are red lines. Fundamentally a religion does define the existence of a domain which might be termed sacred; which in the H system is related to praxis; so interference or infringement of those domains are red lines." \[[MT_TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/703393262485282816)\]
- vAma-tantra-s involve deliberate transgression of these sacred limits in the hopes of liberation. \[ST in Sutra\]

#### Participation by abstinence
- "When you participate in a religion, you do so, not only by doing what you are obligated to do, or doing something optional but allowed for you, but also by not doing what is prohibited. ..." {[GA18](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2018/07/22/a-short-discussion-on-pertinent-issues-presented-by-the-sabarimala-matter/)}

## Structure vs feeling tension

- The veda-s emphasize both proper and meticulous performance; and feeling (There is the story {[TS 2.6.10](https://archive.org/stream/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series/ASS_042_Krishna_Yajurvediya_Taittiriya_Samhita_Part_5_-_Kasinath_Sastri_Agase_1946#page/n93/mode/1up)} of shaMyu who to whom fruits of yajJNA are to be diverted, if it is performed without devotional feeling or without respect for prescribed structure).
- "Of course, if we say "just pray from heart", it becomes too open and possibly chaotic. Rules are there to enforce discipline and provide some structure. But, if there are too many rules, the same thing that is intended to provide structure to the ritual can become constricting and suffocating. The suffocation may eliminate all feeling from the ritual. Based on one's desa-kala-patra, one has to find the right balance between rules (Pingala, solar channel) and emotion (Ida, lunar channel). One should follow some rules that provide a structure without suffocating one and allow one to add emotion to the ritual. Then one can make a connection." [NR_FB15](https://www.facebook.com/pvr108/posts/10153156010758284).


### Examples of "feeling" trumping:
#### In the veda-s 
\[[TW17](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/853343223342878721)\].

- "kavaSa ailUSa who was expelled by the RSis from a sattra on account of his maternal heritage (she was a dAsa woman; I suspect druhyu heritage). Expelled to the desert & suffering from thirst he sees the aponaptrīya sūkta and in the desert, the waters of the sarasvatI run to him."
- "The innocent, naive devotee whose silly actions still please the deity: kaNNappa nAyanmAr's spitting water on rudra as ablution to a creative mind, can be said to be prefigured in the story of apālā who chews the soma plant with her teeth to press out the juice for Indra."
- "The trope of the devotee who risks everything for his cherished deva: could be said to be prefigured in the story of Rjrashva who, seeing a she-wolf (and recognizing it as the divine animal it was; I.e. Sent by the ashvinau), offered a hundred sheep to satiate it and was blinded by his father as a consequence! However, the ashvinau, pleased with him, gave back his eyes."

#### In the itihAsa-s and purANa-s
- shabari giving rAma berries she tasted for sweetness.
- Hunter kaNNappa spitting water on rudra as ablution.

  
## Language

Ritual (mantra-s and hymns therein) can involve specialized language. The use and preservation of sanskrit for ritual purposes was an important ancestral IE trait - seen in Lithuanians, Romans and Indo-Aryans (ref. patanjalI).

Yet, local languages were harmoniously integrated in later ritual systems which involved non IE devotees. Though, some opposers of Agama and veda-s have tried to use this as a dividing point ([Chidambaram08 HK](https://haindavakeralam.com/atheist-assault-shiva-temple-hk14653)).

## Initiation

A western pagan reconstructionist's view ([KR16](https://krasskova.wordpress.com/2016/06/23/thoughts-on-initiation/)) with divination for compatibility testing etc.. is consonant with many hindu mantra traditions.

### Eligibility limitations

- The [right to exclusivity](../communal-support/exclusivity/) (based on gender, stage of life, varNa, position etc..) naturall applies.

## Surprising (to some) ritual components

Some unusual rituals involve some unusual components, some of which people may not like. But denying that such rituals exist is not a tenable response. They were proposed because of some benefit in terms of enjoyment or refinement of sentiment. Rather, the performer should use his discretion to modify rituals to suit his and his society's temperaments.

- Animal and human sacrifice (../considered [here](../social-cultivation/violence/))

### Exchange of abuses
- Example -
    - gavAmayana ritual - mahAvrata day ([img](http://i.imgur.com/BaUxdMU.jpg), [img2](http://i.imgur.com/r4qU6nv.png))
    - ashvamedha

### Ritual fights
- Certain vaidika rituals

### Imitation of animals (mimesis)
- In shrauta tradition - gosava rite. ([ghorAngIrasa](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/gosava-and-bovine-mimesis-in-ritual-part-1/))
- Motivation - Ananda ([TW16](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/747747908552822786)), various other rewards
- Modern examples: Joe Hutto.

### Sex
- See various sexual symbolisms used in adoring deities [here](../../tattvam/deva/index/).

#### niyoga (sperm donation)
- ashvamedha having a niyoga component at one point in time.
  - The queen ritually sleeps with the horse, is given over to the Rtvik-s and then taken back.
  - MT: "obscene yajuSh recited when the queen likes near the horse: ambe ambAlyambike na mA yabhati kashchana | sa sastyashvakaH | haye cha haye asau ||" (Note c)
  - MT: "this has deep roots in the Indo-European world with parallel sexual connotations in the horse rituals in other tradiitons e.g. in Rome" To check: gaulish iipomidvos.
  - MT points out that a literal and realist reading of rAmAyaNa clearly imlies niyoga performed by the fecund Rtvik RShyashRnga. *(Of course, the text must be read from other perspectives as well.)*
  - MT: "Now it is not explicit as in the mahAbhArata where vyAsa fathers the protagonists (stated clearly) but the parallel is important: 1. vyAsa fathers on ambikA, ambAlikA and sUtA(names parallel to the chant in the ashvamedha see above). 2. He asks for a 1 year vrata ike horse ritual but they don't observe and the outcome is a disaster."
- As an indication of fertility
  - gavAmayana ritual - mahAvrata day ([img](http://i.imgur.com/BaUxdMU.jpg), [img2](http://i.imgur.com/r4qU6nv.png))

#### For spiritual highs 
- group sex
    - the tAntrika chakrapUjA
- Exceptional (possible) incest
    - abhinavagupta in tantrAloka itself at 29.102d: śvapatnī bhaginī mātā duhitā vā subhā sakhī. Such allowances were rarely followed through, as kalhaNa reveals.
    - gosava rite (Ap. XXII.13.1-3 - tene.s.tvaa samvatsaram pazuvrato bhavati / upaavahaayodakam pibet t.r.naani caacchindyaat / upa maataram iyaad upa svasaaram upa sagotraam / [indology list](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/1998-February/010645.html), [ghorAngIrasa](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/gosava-and-bovine-mimesis-in-ritual-part-1/))
        - " The controversial acts are limited to the variant given in the jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa (2.113), the āpastamba śrautasūtra (22.13.1-3) that seems to have replicated the verses in the jaiminīya text and the brahmāṇḍa purāṇa (2.36-64). " ([ghorAngIrasa](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/gosava-and-bovine-mimesis-in-ritual-part-1/))
        - "Others don't talk about it or assume you know the details. Panchaviṃśa comes out and says these are no longer performed.""

### Unusual offerings
- In an AV practice taught by AchArya kAnkAyana, the paddhati says a sthalipakam cooked in retas and sutaka jala is offered. In practice samidhs dipped in those are offered.
- Oil instead of ghee in tAntrika and AtharvaNa homa-s
    - "ashvattha-parNa-darvyA i~NgiDa-tailena juhoti | atharvavede sUktam 6.75 tasya prayogaH"
- AV practices include offering poisonous seeds etc.. \[[TW1](https://twitter.com/RangaTheDude/status/880476974145077248)\]

### Fireworks!
    
-  एभिः कारणैः प्रामुख्यक्रमेणसूचितैर् दीपोत्सवः सविस्फोटम् आचरणीय इति मदभिप्रायः  -
    - *‌ स्फोटकप्रयोगेनोत्सवस्याचरणेन नन्दन्तितमाम् बहवो जना इत्यपि सत्यम्। तेन हिन्दुकानाम् अत्यन्तसाधारणानामपि स्वसमुदायेन म्लेच्छभिन्नेन सहैक्यभावना वर्द्धते। (युद्धकल्पना दीपोत्सवे न ममैकाकिन एव जातस् स्याद् बाल्यकाले 🙂, अविस्मरणीयरोमाञ्चनम्। )
    - \* यस्मिन् कस्मिन्नपि कर्मणि काचिद्धानिर्वा दोषो वा सम्भवति पृकृत्यैव (यथा होमाग्नि-दीपागर्वादिभ्यो ऽपि धूमः, पाके लघुजीवानाम् हत्या)। सर्वं यज्ञस्वरूपम् इत्यतः किमप्य् अदत्त्वा लाभोऽस्माकं सम्भवतीति मोहः।
    - *‌ ४००-वर्षेभ्यो दीपोत्सवे स्फोटकादीनाम् प्रयोगो दृश्यत इति चित्रादिप्रमाणावलोकनेन स्पष्टम्। \[प्रमाण-[चित्राणि](https://www.quora.com/What-historical-connection-is-there-between-firecrackers-and-Diwali-When-did-Indians-start-bursting-crackers-and-how-did-it-become-a-part-of-our-culture/answer/Deep-Patel-77)\]

#### Drinking and offering liquor
- Certain vaidika and tAntrika rituals
    - sautramaNi - [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/05/06/on-the-sautramani/). Said to counter the effect of too much soma- "The Asvins performed the Sautramani ritual to cure Indra from the effects of drinking too much Soma. "

#### Mock gambling
    - Certain vaidika rituals

#### Unusual ritual equipment
- Turbans
    - shyenayAga is a sAmavediya abhicAra prayoga referred to in Sdv.Br and LSS involves the Rtviks wearing red turbans and red garments. \[[TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/889324912749330432)\]
- Weapon displays
    - Certain vaidika and tAntrika rituals
    -  5th sAdhyaHkra soma ritual: The shuklayajurvedin-s specify the deity there as agni-rudravat to whom a red animal is sacrificed. Also the ritualists where their upavita around the neck like a garland for the ritual. They carry bows strap quivers to back full of arrows while performing the yAga.
- Skulls
    - In chayana during vaidika yAga-s [here](http://i.imgur.com/1H9XrMy.png).
        - SYV tradition
            - "by the time of the shatapatha, the use of actual heads had been out of vogue  for long...with the last one to use it being shyAparNa sAyakAyana".  shatapatha brAhmaNa admonishes against the usage of golden and clay heads for agnicayana.
            - But katyayana accepts the clay n gold options.
                - Hence, commentator karka says: "Build a shed near the yAgashAla; kill him there like any pashu."; but allows substitutions.
        - Apastamba asks for skulls to be purchased. kSatriya or vaishya who got killed by arrow or struck by lightning. 
    - Famously carried around by kapAlika-s and such.
- Threatening the deities! Some stretch the concept of deities coming under the control of the invoker a bit too far.  
- Several shabara (non-sanskrit) mantra-s threaten a deity with dire consequences if the requests of the chanter are not granted. Example: [rati-threatening](http://i.imgur.com/CDSKIBg.png).

#### Posession and wildly altered behavior
- Avesha has a deep history in hindu thought \[[IF16](../http://indiafacts.org/brief-study-possession-hinduism-ii-spiritual-context/)\], and is an important part of many rituals (see [mantra page](../self-cultivation/mantra-yantra/)).
    - "It is also important to note, and this is another vital differentiation between casual pop-ideas of possession and that which comes to us from śāstras, is that the act can be initiated either by the possessor or the possessed." \[[IF16](http://indiafacts.org/brief-study-possession-hinduism-ii-spiritual-context/)\]
    - "while true āvesa is full-fledged entering of a deity or force into another individual, thus altering his individuality completely, bhāvāvesa is a more specific experience, where the self-identity of the subject is not necessarily threatened." \[[IF16](http://indiafacts.org/brief-study-possession-hinduism-ii-spiritual-context/)\]
- Christian version [FB16](https://archive.org/stream/apastamba/EkagniKandam#page/n13/mode/2up).

## pUjA: Adoration of the deva-s

Several are the ways one expresses adoration (performs pUjA) towards the deva-s. The beings adored could in general be various deva-s or yakSha-s or ancestors (pitR-s) or sages etc..

- A physical body (vigraha), as a focus of attention, and as a concentration of power
    - Consecration
        - mantra-s and tantra-s are used to consecrate an image and make it fit and powerful for adoration.
        - Limited aspects of the devatA (aka mantresha-s) enter the image.
    - Damages and repair
        - Should the physical form be damaged or destroyed, the mantresha-s are not affected. They simply leave the idol. Rather, harm comes those who failed in their duty to protect the vigraha. (eg. pauShkara-samhitA "kṣatam utpātapūrvaistu doṣaistu nṛpanāśakṛt" \[[Paus_36.433](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/vaisn/ps27-43u.htm)\]). The intolerant destroyers themselves pay too eventually (having deviated from the dharma).
        - The mantresha-s can be reinvited with appropriate rituals and mantras.
    - Forms
        - Using abstract representations
            - One may invoke the deva-s into objects of various kinds - the darbha grass, some trees, the sacrificial fire, stones (say a sAligrAma), kalasha-s, geometric patterns (maNDala-s), weapons etc..
                - In this age where everyone has some sort of ADD, there cannot be a better sAdhanA than homa. The fire binds attention like superglue. I encourage everyone to try it. [VA](http://vedicastrologer.org/homam/index.htm) has good tips.
            - Some representations seem to be partly associated with human genitalia, such as a linga (shiva, and rarely viShNu, brahma  - [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/22/the-tale-of-the-linga/), [KV](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/08/12/linga-the-phallic-symbol-of-the-ultimate-being/), [S](http://sarasvatam.in/en/2015/08/18/li%E1%B9%85ga-worship-in-vai%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87ava-agamas/)) or yoni (devI) may be used.
                - linga of shiva.
                    - linga can mean both a symbol and a phallus.
                    - Though to modern devotees, the linga tends to be a symbol of shiva (with no sexual connotations), it had associations with the erect human phallus, representing the yogic Urdhvaretas power and paradoxical fertility of shiva.
                        - Eg. the ancient linga at [guDimallam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudimallam). There are also several images of shiva with an erect phallus.
                        - किरातपतेर् ऊर्ध्वरेतस्त्वं यो न जानाति स खलु प्रायेण नावगच्छति लिङ्गस्य स्वारस्यमित्य् अनुमामि। 
                - Yoni-pUjA (vagina worship) -
                    - The vagina represents godess, who is the source of everything, creation, the original desire.
                    - Eg. In the case of the kAmAkhyA godess in Assam. [Article](https://shestirs.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/kamakhya-the-goddess-of-desire/). Goddess’ menses blood is Prasad in these temples.
                    - There are menstruation festivals in Orissa, where the Earth is considered to be mensturating, and hence should not be ploughed.
                    - In several parts of India, dedicated to womens' attainment of puberty is celebrated.
                - Comparison elsewhere
                    - Japan [DM](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xwqdhj_feasts-japanese-culture_travel).
        - Using images: Intricate images of the deva, as visualized by the sages, may be constructed.
- One can then offer adoration by:
    - Caring for the deity's body by bathing, offering perfumes, food, drink, pastes, ornaments, fragrances.
        - Some of these offerings may be specially selected to invoke the desired feelings. Examples.
            - Horsegram is considered a favorite of the horse headed hayagrIva.
            - In the indra dhvaja festival images of genitalia were made from mixture of wheat and brown sugar and offered before the dhvaja. Their offering was accompanied by telling of jokes to induce laughter in the assembled (The Mbh records it). It was generally not seen as correct for V1s to eat those after they were offered but the rest of the community did eat them. 
        - Violence and sacrifice: see [here](../../social-cultivation/violence/).
    - addressing verses of praise, songs, dances to the deity.
