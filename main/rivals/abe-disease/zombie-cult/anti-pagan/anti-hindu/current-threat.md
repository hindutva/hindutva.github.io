- Connecting nAzi-ism more with hindus and pagans
  - "Nazi icon was *not* a modified version of any Hindu symbol. The Nazi icon was a CHRISTIAN crucification symbol, hooked cross. Hitler doesn’t call it swastika even once in Mein Kampf (https://agiw.fak1.tu-berlin.de/Scriptorium/Zu%20S37/HAMK1943.pdf …) - always Hakenkruis. Calling it Swastika is a Christian whitewash." - {[ST](https://twitter.com/bhAratenduH/status/1013027841691279360)} "Hitler saw Hooked Cross symbol in a Christian monastery (Lambach Abbey)and adopted it as emblem for his party." {[ST](https://twitter.com/TrueIndology/status/1015663967451078657)}

## Christian rebel groups in the North-East:
- Bodoland
    - "The Bodoland struggle has also become polarised along religious lines, with the [Hindu dominated, Bodo Liberation Tigers Force (BLTF) supporting the security forces against the Christian dominated NDFB](http://books.google.ca/books?id=ApzUuLiO0jYC&pg=PA268&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)[\[1\]](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/#_edn1)" ([BODO-2015](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/).)
    - "Under influence of the Christian West, they have tried to de-Indianise their language by forcing people to adopt the Roman script for their language. On 19 August 2000, NDFB killed Bineshwar Brahma, the president of the Bodo Sahitya Academy, for using Devanagari script and refusing to adopt the Roman script for the Bodo language." ([BODO-2015](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/).)
- Tripura
    - "The NLFT is accused of forcing Tripura’s indigenous tribes to become Christians and give up Hindu forms of worship in areas under their control. In 1999, they issued a ban on the Hindu festivals of Durga Puja and Saraswati Puja. The [NLFT manifesto](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/south_asia/717775.stm) says that they want to expand what they describe as the kingdom of God and Christ in Tripura. ... Nagmanlal Halam, secretary of the Noapara Baptist Church in Tripura, was [arrested](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/south_asia/717775.stm) with a large quantity of explosives. In August 1999, [they kidnapped 4 RSS pracharaks](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Abducted-RSS-men-killed-in-Tripura/articleshow/472452524.cms), held them for ransom, and later, murdered them. ... At least 20 Hindu tribals, including a senior priest of the Jirania Ashram, Santi Kali Maharaj, have been [killed by NLFT](http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/aug/02trip.htm) rebels in the past two years for disobeying orders. ... They also butchered [Hindu Bengali refugees](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1000522/the_east.htm) in cold blood in the Bagber Refugee camp at Bagber in August 2001."

- nAga-land
    - "One such faction of the NSCN is led by Isak Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah.... Its [manifesto](http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/nagaland/terrorist_outfits/nscn_im.htm) is based on the principle of Socialism for economic development and a spiritual outlook — ‘Nagaland for Christ’. ...  The original NNC (Naga Nationalist Council) recognised two religions — Christianity and Naga religions. However, the [NSCN (IM) faction dropped the Naga religion](https://books.google.ca/books?id=_8ylAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT57&lpg=PT57&dq=nscn+christian&source=bl&ots=XeDscfObEC&sig=3igrfcVP0qldgichZWPj_7iwvbM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ehCfVN-FLdKTyATQ3IGoAw&sqi=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=nscn%20christian&f=false) from the list of its recognised religions[\[3\]](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/#_edn3). The very first mission maintained an adversarial relationship with the native Naga faith and when the Christians had increased in sufficient numbers, imposed a no observance of tribal customs and festivals[\[4\]](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/#_edn4). Missionaries forbade consumption of indigenous wine (zam), which according to Vashum was a vital component of their native culture[\[5\]](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/#_edn5), thus imposing their [own version of prohibition](https://books.google.ca/books?id=_8ylAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT57&lpg=PT57&dq=nscn+christian&source=bl&ots=XeDscfObEC&sig=3igrfcVP0qldgichZWPj_7iwvbM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ehCfVN-FLdKTyATQ3IGoAw&sqi=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=nscn%20christian&f=false). The NSCN-K official Wangdong Chaktey has ordered that no Rangsomhum could be constructed in any village of that area. ... British reverend Michael Scott supplied lethal weapons packed in Red Cross boxes to NNC militants. With the help of international Church organisations and foreign NGOs, NSCN (IM) has several support centres in the Netherlands, Thailand, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, South Korea, Australia, England, Philippines, Sweden, Belgium and the US. ... Tikhak Buddhists of Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh on Thursday observed Buddha Purnima under the vigil of security forces. ...  
        “The people in Wangnong and nearby villages have been passing sleepless nights. They are all Buddhists. An armed militant group belonging to the NSCN(IM) has ordered them to convert to Christianity,” said [Ven Aggadhamma, the highest religious leader of the Buddhists in Changlang and Tirap districts](http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/buddhists-allege-nscnim-threat/624612/)."([BODO-2015](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/).)
- Mizoram
    - "An [explosion ripped through a temple](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/explosion-in-mizoram-temple/article4744678.ece), on the premises of the 26th battalion of Assam Rifles here on Thursday (23 May 2013), when the opposition Mizo National Front organised \`Milem Biak Duhloh Kawngzawh’ or \`anti-idol worshipping rally.’ The MNF was also instrumental in the[expulsion of the mostly Hindu-animist Bru (Reang) tribe](http://www.achrweb.org/reports/india/AR08/mizoram.html). About 29,000 Bru tribals were expelled from Mizoram. ... The series of [“Quit Mizoram” notices](http://www.epw.in/reports-states/quit-mizoram-notices.html) served by the MNF to non-Mizos since the 70s started including relaxations from May 1982 onwards."

- Assam
    - "The Bhuvan Pahar, one of the most holy places in Barak valley of Assam has come under the threat of miscreants for last two months… Gun totting members of a newly formed militant organization, namely, Manmasi National Christian Army (MNCA), comprising about fifteen rebels, has been forcing the Hindu residents of Bhuvan Pahar, under the threat of gun to convert to Christianity. ...  The problem began when Hmar miscreants stated themselves to be the members of Manmasi National Christian Army and had started putting pressure on the Hindu residents of Bhuvan Pahar to become Christian. The [local residents informed that Manmasi National Christian Army cadres had painted Cross symbol](http://www.assamtimes.org/node/2986) on the wall of the temples with their blood. ...  
        The HPC-D has also been [collecting money from US based groups](http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/mizoram/terrorist_outfits/HPC_D.htm) for protecting Hmar Christians. A [bomb explosion in the ISKCON Krishna temple in Imphal](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-5-dead-50-injured-in-bomb-blast-in-iskcon-temple-in-imphal-1047601), which killed 5, and injured over 50 others was attributed to Christian Kuki terror outfits."
