## Introduction

- See [general evaluation here](../abe-disease/).
- The classic baptist condemnation of Hiduism with concepts such as "true vs false gods", "importance of using the right name for god", devil-worship, the coming of the anti-christ etc.. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8nWky51XCc).

### Mutations

- Dominant clade: Nicene creed.
- Rex Mundi is a esoteric figure of Templars and other orders, who created this physical world which is evil.
- Regarding non-believers
    - Interestingly, Jehovah's witnesses don't believe in non-witnesses (who've consciously refused to obey jehovah) being ressurrected for torture after judgement. They just won't be resurrected at all.

#### Epistemological atheism

- Aka reactionary atheism.
- NNT said wisely: "Indeed,  Atheism is a sect of Protestantism. (For one to be an atheist, religious "belief" has to be epistemic.) ... Atheism is not part of Paganism.  Atheism is an extreme version of Protestantism."
- Secularism (../Described [separately](../0-theism/secularism/).)

#### More agreeable mutations

- The gnostics were so perplexed with the world as it is that they were convinced that the "God" of the OT must be a wicked being. They called him demiurge/yaldabaoth.
- Cathars considered the rAkshasa of OT as a rAkShasa. They were burned by the pope.
- Quakers believe in continuing revelation, and equal access to the "light" by everyone.
    - "we fully welcome lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people into our fellowship, even though the Bible seems to some on the surface to condemn homosexuality, condone slavery, deny women’s role in ministry, and require outward sacramental practice.  And we remain open to new light, expecting that God will intend further changes for us in the future." \[[Q](http://www.nyym.org/?q=WhatQuakersBelieve)\]

## Personality of Jesus

- Below, we talk about the Nicene Jesus. (Gnostic Christ seems have been \*much\* better. There were other "Christ"s too - some say all of them were fictional.)
- Jesus, if he existed, was racist. (As more non-jew converts came in, this was subsumed by a broader out-group hostility.)
    - (Matthew 15:21-28 and Mark 7:24-30) - "Gentile (non-Jew) woman once begged him to cast away the demon that had possessed her daughter... He cold-heartedly told the woman that only the Jews were his children and that the Gentiles were dogs. He wouldn’t heal a dog. Only then Jesus relented."([Kalavai-201501](http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY), [verse in KJ bible and translation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%E0%AE%AE%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%AF%E0%AF%81+15%3A21-28&version=KJV))
- Jesus was misogynist. ([Kalavai-201501](http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY))
- Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet. ([Kalavai-201501](http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY))
    - Early christians prophesied that he will cause a bloody genocide to happen.
        - "According to The Bible, Jesus would return to the earth holding a sickle in his hand (Revelation 14:14). An angel would tell him that it is time to start a bloody genocide. Another sickle-wielding angel would join Jesus and the duo would start a violent carnage. The blood they spill would cover the ground up to the horses’ bridles in a space of 1,600 furlongs (Revelation 14:15-20). ... According to this contradictory biblical prophecy, Jesus would unleash the might of the sword and hunger to annihilate a fourth of the population (Revelation 6:8).  ... Jesus would then let loose four angels, who would massacre one-third of the remaining population (i.e., 1.75 billion). Jesus won’t take the chill pill yet. He would instead command 200 million fire-breathing horsemen to massacre a third of the survivors. " ([Kalavai-jesus-genocide](http://indiafacts.co.in/jesus-christ-impending-genocide/#.VLE2gDlGjUZ))
    - Jesus was not a Yogi because he said "Kingdom of God is within you."
        - " As Bart Ehrman has shown (Jesus Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible, pp. 77-78), not only is the Sermon on the Mount a very late interpolation into the Bible but its message is not one of inward perfection as in the Yoga. Its message is apocalyptic; Jesus expected the end of the world to happen very soon. The verse actually means that the coming Kingdom of God is there and present among the Jewish Christians that were his contemporary followers. In this racist teaching, Gentiles are excluded from that kingdom. "([Kalavai-201501](http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY))
        - "The result was a dishonest book, The Kingdom of God is Within You, in which Tolstoy gave the apocalyptic Jesus a complete botox-like makeover and transformed him into a contemplative teacher who sought perfection within as a Hindu yogi does. Many unthinking Hindus, starting with Mahatma Gandhi, have popularized this propagandist story without realizing that it serves to disarm and proselytize unsuspecting  Hindus." ([Kalavai-201501](http://indiafacts.co.in/a-caution-to-hindus-who-think-jesus-is-dharmic-or-a-saint/#.VLEtHTlGjUY))
- Jesus did not abrogate the troublesome 10 commandments (such as the one against image worship). \[Catholic view: [2015-here](http://www.catholic.com/quickquestions/did-jesus-alter-the-commandment-about-observing-the-sabbath), [image](http://i.imgur.com/e96q67P.png)\] 

## Strong out-group hostility.

- Anti-heathenism is noted elsewhere.
- Anti-jewish progroms were strongly spurred by christianity, culminating in nAzi doctrine.
    - "Jews and Their Lies" by Martin Luther.
- "Generation Atheist by Dan Riley" contains testimonies from children thrown out of home because of being atheists, the teenager Jessica Ahlquist who successfully challenged Christian indoctrination at Rhode Island Public School and faced threats.

## Exploitation of the "flock"

- Televangelists scamming poor and vulnerable people with faith healing and "send me seed money" prosperity promises, while leading rich lives. [LWT15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xJAVZxXg).
- Church priests raping children.

## Problems with Science

- Medieval History
    - MT [says](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/): "The heathen revivalist Plethon and his students reintroduced classical Greek thought back into [Cosimo de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosimo_de%27_Medici)'s court and had a great influence on key figures in the renaissance. ... It was under the aegis of this forum provided by the Medici clan that Leonardo, several other artists and later Galileo \[who dedicated his Sidereus Nuncius to member of the clan\] received patronage."
    - MT [says](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/): "First, the followers of the shavamata quickly realized that Plethon was introducing something really dangerous to their foundations: indeed, he has himself remarked to a pretAcharin that both the religions of love and peace would soon be replaced by heathenism, like that of the Hellenes. At the same time they saw that the attractive feature of Plethon’s thought was the knowledge which it brought along on scientific and mathematical topics: this is apparent from both their and the Moslems’ acknowledgment (even with tinge of admiration, despite loathing for his heathenism) of the extensive knowledge of Plethon. Thus, the realized that the best thing for the shavamata would be to absorb this knowledge and recast it inside an Abrahamistic framework while throwing out the heathenism propounded by Plethon. Ironically, this happened right in the academy of the Medici’s which was inspired by Plethon wherein his descendents in the preceptorial line like Bessarion and Argyropoulos tried to work his ideas into the pretamata. This is comparable to the earlier appropriation of heathen material by the pretamata during the period of the fall of the Roman empire. On the whole what happened was that the pretamata was not diluted, but it simply digested the alien ideas and incorporated them into its corpus."
    - In the Middle Ages, the view that the Book of Nature and the Book of Scripture must be harmonious (because they have the same "author") led to non-literal interpretations of scripture to conform to empirical data. \[??\]
        - William of Conch (1100-1154) said: "Since the same earth, water and heat continue to exist today, there is no natural reason why new human races are not produced naturally from their interaction. Since we have never seen this happen, there must be some divine prohibition against it." This is an astounding example from medieval times by a Christian theologian who invokes God not to create living things but to prevent them from naturally getting created." 
    - The chruch famously opposed novel scientific ideas of Copernicus and Galelio (whom it forced to recant). We have also seen a 100 year long rejection of the principle of natural selection. Some even opposed the printing press ([IMG](http://i.imgur.com/HwXHBXK.jpg)) and mathematics ([TW](https://twitter.com/pickover/status/769911258699145216))!
    - There is a view that the Christian doctrine of causation (especially the separation of primary and secondary causes) helped the birth of modern science. Only a few phenomena, like Jesus' resurrection and the initial moment of creation were thought to be directly caused by God (primary causation). Every thing else was caused by secondary (naturalistic) causes which did not require God's constant intervention. God sets creation in motion and then the intrinsic natures of things carry the process forward.
    - To find out which phenomena are caused directly by God (miracles), it becomes important to understand what the "common course of nature" is. Only then can deviations from that common course be detected. An investigation into the common course of nature for the discernment of miracles contributed to the development of modern science.
- Current status
    - Catholic church
        - Accepts the theory of evolution and the big bang theory since around 1950-s. (Francis [quote](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120025/pope-francis-quotes-evolution-big-bang-are-nothing-celebrate)) Main question is when God managed to insert a soul into humans.
    - Miscellaneous American creationists
        - Reject big bang, the theory of evolution, even human induced global warming as of 2014.

### Secularism, Sacred vs profane distinction

Thoughts on this are [here](../../../self-cultivation/rituals/).

## Connection with the European Renaissance and Enlightenment

- Ideals such as secularism and secular humanism are not Christian ideas, but reactions to them.
    - Even protestant champions such as Martin Luther and Calvin were anti semites and demagogues.
- Renaissance and Enlightenment was a rebellion against contemporary Christian ideas.
    - A critical role played by pagans like Plethon and his followers \[[MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/)\].
    - Many Hindu texts were translated to European languages and that is why Voltaire, Nietzsche, etc., profoundly cite those.

    - Timeline
        - 11th–13th centuries: Crusades attempted to control the Holy Land. Lands not occupied by Christians were deemed vacant. The Church arbitrated land claims among Christian monarchs.
        - 15th century: Papal bulls (1452, 1453, 1493, and following) authorized only Christian monarchies as sovereign, and encouraged them to vanquish and place in perpetual slavery/servitude any heathens, pagans, Saracens, or other non-Christian peoples. For example, Portuguese developed the slave trade along the west African coast. The Church required “discovery” of land that was not occupied by Christians and to bring it under Church dominion. The peoples in Asia, Africa, and the Americas were not deemed sovereign as they were not Christian. The papacy authorized military conquest to assist conversion to Christianity.
        - 16th–18th centuries: Church-based claims to sovereignty by Spain, Portugal, and France became transferable to other Christian monarchies through treaty. Protestant monarchies, such as the British Crown under Henry VIII, reasserted themselves as Christian sovereigns, a status further bolstered by treaties and dynastic marriages.
        - 1783: The Treaty of Paris between the British Crown and the United States of America recognized the United States of America as a “sovereign” government (though not a monarchy).
        - 1823: US Supreme Court case Johnson v. M’Intosh made “discovery doctrine” explicit in US law. The court denied individuals permission to buy land from American Indian tribes \[nations\]. Under the doctrine, the court assumed only a sovereign United States could acquire the land, should the Indians choose to sell. In this decision, Indians were given a limited right of “occupancy” without full title to their own land, and could thus lose their land if they could not prove continuous occupancy. The doctrine was reframed in secular terms, in which the criterion for sovereignty became “cultivators of land” instead of “Christians.”
        - 1955: US Supreme Court case Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States  relied on the doctrine of discovery. The court ruled that because “Tee-Hit-Tons were in a hunting and fishing stage of civilization” they had only a limited right of occupancy, and therefore the US was not required to reimburse the Tee-Hit-Ton for timber harvested from their land.

But, in many places, Asian churches have been deeply associated with independent and democratic movements in different countries.

### Past misdeeds in India
#### Portuguese Catholic assault
- Francis Xavier and Portuguese rule.
    - “The fruit that is reaped by the baptism of infants, as well as by the instruction of children and others, is quite incredible…Whenever I hear of any act of idolatrous worship, I go to the place with a large band of these children, who very soon load the devil \[statues of Hindu gods\] with a greater amount of insult and abuse…The children run at the idols, upset them, dash them down, break them to pieces, spit on them, trample on them, kick them about, and in short heap on them every possible outrage.” \[[Xaviers college letter](http://centreright.in/2014/04/an-open-letter-to-the-students-of-st-xaviers-college-mumbai/comment-page-1/#.VLJ5LjlGjUY)\]
    - Goa inquisition \[[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition)\]
        - [SV_YT18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nEseljBZ-c&feature=youtu.be)
        - "In his letter to John III, King of Portugal, dated 16th May 1545, Xavier called upon the king to “establish the Holy Inquisition” because there were many who lived according to their laws of belief and “without any fear of God or shame of the world.”" \[[Xaviers college letter](http://centreright.in/2014/04/an-open-letter-to-the-students-of-st-xaviers-college-mumbai/comment-page-1/#.VLJ5LjlGjUY)\]

When the attempts largely failed, the missionaries destroyed nearby temples, which enraged the villagers, resulting in the massacre of some priests including Fr. Rudolfo Acquaviva - an Italian Jesuit who had also held position at Emperor Akbar's court and has since been beatified - and their colleagues on July 15, 1583."

- Suppression of Indian "Syrian" christian customs by that were in harmony with the surrounding hindu society \[[Olikara1](http://www.nasrani.net/2011/05/19/the-heathen-and-the-syrian-syrian-christian-ritual-and-tradition-pre-1599-a-d/)\] is a good example of the deracination that accompanies strong enforcement of Christian doctrine.
    - Prior to this:
        - They believed that different faiths and religious observances were but different ways of reaching the same God.
        - Their children studied in Hindu schools and children of other faiths studied in our schools too.
        - They held the Hindu philosophies of transmigration of souls and that of fate dear to our hearts.
        - Hindu musicians played in churches during church festivals.
        - They celebrated hindu festivals like Onam.
        - They were indistinguishable in dress and appearance from the heathens.
    - General high status and friendliness:
        - "As a reward for their services, a few Syrian Christian families were given honored privileges in many state rituals by the rulers. In Cochin, Syrian Christian prelates participated in the installation ceremonies of the rulers. During the premier Kerala festival, Onam, part of the regalia for the rituals was stored in a Cochin Syrian Christian church. The procession carrying the Hindu deity, Krishna, at that festival was expected by custom to make a brief stop at the home of a prominent Syrian Christian family who had contributed to the cost of financing that procession. The high status of the Syrian Christians in Hindu society was reflected everywhere by their right of access to Hindu society was reflected everywhere by their right of access to Hindu shrines and ‘sacred space’. In Alleppey, a newly emerging urban center in Tranvancore, during the eighteenth country, a Hindu temple and a Syrian Christian church were built on adjoining sites, a practice found in the case of older churches and temples in places such as Niranom, Chengannur, Kallopara, and Parur between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Christians continued to use Hindu style torches, umbrellas, and banners at their festivals to honor saints and bishops of the Syrian church. There was at least one Hindu temple that lent its temple elephants for Syrian Christian festival processions." \[Gheverghese [article](http://centreright.in/2012/09/the-syrian-christians-of-kerala-part-1/comment-page-1/#.VLMfADlGjUY)\].
    - Prominent betrayal by Syrian Christians:
        - They welcomed British Christian rule, did not support independence struggle and organized to subvert local hindu hierarchy. \[[TW](https://twitter.com/Madame_Micawber/status/886057335239651332)\]
        - "When Vasco-da-Gama arrived at Cochin on his second voyage (1502) , a delegation of Thomas Christians went to met him and implored protection." \[[Malankara webpage](http://malankaraorthodoxchurch.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=221)\]

#### Christian charity
- Social and medical work was/ is used by the missionaries to prepare the ground for conversion.
    - Though Christian propaganda may use the following creed to spread "1. Do good to your neighbours. 2. Forgive your enemies. 3. Spread my message all over.", we have noted that Christianity is far more sinister.
- Mother Teresa, the angel from hell
    - Christopher Hitchens [says](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html): "MT was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a gift from God. ... Many more people are poor and sick because of the life of MT: Even more will be poor and sick if her example is followed. She was a fanatic, a fundamentalist, and a fraud, and a church that officially protects those who violate the innocent has given us another clear sign of where it truly stands on moral and ethical questions."
    - Regarding the abysmal quality of care for her poor patients, we have plenty of testimony from disillusioned volunteers. \[CH's [documentary shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65JxnUW7Wk4#t=382).\] Mother Teresa herself referred to the facilities as "Houses of the Dying".
        - [Lancet published](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2894%2991759-0/fulltext) a critical account of the care in Mother Teresa's facilities in 1994. [An academic Canadian study](http://www.nouvelles.umontreal.ca/udem-news/news/20130301-mother-teresa-anything-but-a-saint.html) from a couple of years ago found fault with "her rather dubious way of caring for the sick etc..
    - Baptisms of the dying: In a speech at the Scripps Clinic in California in January 1992, she said: "Something very beautiful... not one has died without receiving the special ticket for St. Peter, as we call it. We call baptism ticket for St. Peter. We ask the person, do you want a blessing by which your sins will be forgiven and you receive God? They have never refused. So 29,000 have died in that one house \[in Kalighat\] from the time we began in 1952."

## Unsuccessful fightback

- Kalavai Venkat notes: "(Dalai Lama was refused a meeting by Pope Francis because it might annoy China \[[TOI](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/Pope-refuses-to-meet-Dalai-Lama-as-it-would-annoy-China/articleshow/45526567.cms)\].) Prabhupada did the same. He went to the Vatican, and waited for an audition, only to be told that the pope had canceled the meeting. Sri Sri Ravishankar released audios where he had conversations with Jesus. Thich Nhat Hanh facilitated the shoplifting of the Buddhist meditation techniques and repackaging them as Christian meditation. When would these leaders realize an enemy for what he is?"
