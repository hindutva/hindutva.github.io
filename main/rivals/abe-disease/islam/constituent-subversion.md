title: Subversion as a constituent

### Intro

Muslim society has a pernicious effect on non-muslim (especially polytheistic) societies. 

- Even when muslims are in the minority, the riot-manual injunctions of[sura At-Tawba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-Tawba)have been realized repeatedly.
    - Claims such as "there were no hindu-muslim riots before the British era", or "our temples were destroyed by armies and tyrants alone, none by ordinary rioters" are false. (Eg.[K](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/a-sayyid-kills-a-kashmirian-yogin/),)
    - Many of the "battles" quoted in early islamic history are actually best charactarized as riots, with 10-200 hooligans fighting pagans.
- The "victim narrative" is applied to generate anger and a pan-islamic response.
    - This often involves crafting a narrative around events taken out of context.
        - Eg. Babri masjid demolition, the video of an army killing a mujAhid point-blank in a house it destroyed in a fight.
    - At other times, it involves outright fakery and lies.
        - In modern times:
            - Fake images of Ronghiya persecution in Burma
                - Fake image of a supposedly ronghiya child suckling at the breast of a dead woman (turns out to be from a nepAlI movie). \[[NepMovFake](http://www.reddit.com/r/1000words/comments/1cwrm1/burman_child_tries_to_drink_from_his_dead_mothers/)[FB2015](https://www.facebook.com/shruti.jagdeesh/posts/10155560799370133)[BBC2015](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32979147)\].
- Military betrayal (described below).
- History:
    - Muslim response to Hindu patronage and protection \[[VoD](http://voiceofdharma.org/books/htemples2/ch3.htm)\].
    - Repeated moplah outrages in keraLa 1849-1923. [Tw](https://twitter.com/dasyavevrka/status/629284144023908352/photo/1), [TwImg](http://i.imgur.com/sSZ4d6k.png), [GB](https://books.google.com/books?id=75ZeAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=%22levied+loans+from+rich+Hindoos%22&source=bl&ots=4TSs_tdQyK&sig=Mavcs1U8ZZPp-lbwEMdFEHrbDw4&hl=sa&sa=X&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMItPbWnJCVxwIVWCqICh2SIQqL#v=snippet&q=destroyed&f=false).

  

### Economic damage to society

- Indian economic share went down due to the trauma of Islamic invasion. \[[At16](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/the-economic-history-of-the-last-2-000-years-in-1-little-graph/258676/)\]

#### Parasitic relation to the other

A summary from @parikramah:

- 1\. The jihadi mindset has a split personality of violent dominance or wailing demand w.r.t. Other, & an antipathy to mundane work.
- 2\. Qur'an 8.69 etc make it clear that the normal situation is for the jihadi to live off the kuffar. Many modes are listed.
- 4\. But also in a state of Dar-ul-Harb, via other soft means, making demands for concessions. The Anjem Choudarys live off dole.
- 5\. After British occupation, Indian Muslim Ashraf complained of the "mulazimana zehniyat" (slave mentality) of 9-5 work culture.
- 6\. Loss of sinecures and privy purses, having to compete with kuffar as employees for a living - considered "slavish" by Ashraf.
- 7\. That is "ghanaa" (plenitude) attitude. Next is "faqr" - demands made in "poverty". Both speak from moral high ground.
- 8\. Thus, Sufi "faqeers" ("poor") appeal to  conscience, demanding sustenance - from moral high ground. Like Buddhist bhikshus.
- 9\. Whether in ghanaa or faqr mindset, goal is to live off the Other: "Allah ke naam pe loonga baba" "Allah ke naam pe de de baba"
- 10\. The Other is non-Muslim, or impure Muslims. Many Sufi tariqats considered other Muslims worldly & kuffar. Yet lived off them.

### Criminal activity

- "The findings: about 80% of the criminals at the petty-crime level were Muslims, that figure decreasing when it came to white-collar crime. Please note that under the Indian Penal Code, petty crime includes armed robbery, dacoity and attempted murder - all of which carry heinous penalties by Shariat, which was the point in discussion." \[[RED](http://www.rediff.com/news/sep/05varsha.htm) 2005 varShA\]

### Military and national Betrayal

- Dominant Islamic thought requires betrayal of ones country to further the interests of Islam.

#### Vijayanagara
- Betrayal of two Muslim commanders of Vijayanagara Army at key point in the battle, was the chief cause of the defeat in tAlikoTa. \[\]
- Rama Raya was not a Muslim hating figure.
- Primary sources :
    - Federici Caesaro, the Venetian traveller reports on the betrayal of about 80k soldiers led by two captains.
        - "Father Heras, in Page 211 of his 'Aravidu Dynasty' book, quotes a contemporary European named C. Frederick, 'who heard the account of whole action one year later when he passed through Vijayanagara'. Heras also mentions one Anquetil du Perron, another European of 16th century who wrote "the king \[Ramaraya\] abandoned during the battle by two Muhammadan chiefs, perished."." \[[MH17](http://www.madhvahistory.com/index.php/13-member-articles/accounts-of-empires-kingdoms/39-battle-of-talikota-completes-450-years)\]
    - Tazkiratul – Muluk written by Rafiuddin Shirazi who wrote a history of his patron kings, the Adil Shahis of Bijapur. (Shirazi travelled from Persia and reached Bijapur in 1560.) makes no mention of them.
    - Ferishta’s account does not mention them.

#### Abdali invitation
- Shah Waliullah of Delhi, a venerated scholar, invited Ahmad Shah Abdali of Afghanistan to attack the Maratha in third battle of Panipat and advised his collaborator Najib al Dawla to launch jehad against Jats. Excerpts:
    - "…All control of power is with the Hindus because they are the only people who are industrious and adaptable.  Riches and prosperity are theirs, while Muslims have nothing but poverty and misery.  At this juncture you are the only person, who has the initiative, the foresight, the power and capability to defeat the enemy and free the Muslims from the clutches of the infidels.  God forbid if their domination continues, Muslims will even forget Islam and become undistinguishable from the non-Muslims" (Dr. Sayed Riaz Ahmad in his book 'Maulana Maududi and Islamic state' - Lahore People's Publishing House, page 15 - 1976). 
    - "We beseech you in the name of Prophet to fight a jihad against the infidels of this region… The invasion of Nadir shah, who destroyed the Muslims, left the Marathas and Jats secure and prosperous.  This resulted in the infidels regaining their strength and in the reduction of Muslim leaders of Delhi to mere puppets" ( Shah Wali Allah and his times by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, page page305).

#### INA sabotage and desertion
- Sabotage and desertion in the Indian National Army (INA) - [TW15](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/589763559522963456?s=09).
- Recruitment to safeguard muslim interests [TW](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/589762467238129664). 
- Later ex-INA servicemen were used by pAkistAn in their kAshmIr plunder \[[ChFair](http://i.imgsafe.org/e9b1431594.jpg)\]. "In 1947, Bhimber Tehsil had 35% Hindus + Sikhs. Habibur Rehman, a former aide of Subhas Bose launched a Kabali Jihad on Bhimber."  

#### Gilgit scouts
- Sabotage, defection and revolt of Gilgit scouts, frontier Gilgit rAja-s and the Poonchi muslim troops of Narain singh - [TW16](https://twitter.com/maidros78/status/769913255766683649).
- Officer Nidal Malik Hasan's shooting spree in a US army base \[[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Malik_Hasan)\].        


#### Pakistan creation and the fifth column
- An overwhelming majority of muslims declared their unwillingness to live in a hindu majority democracy and ushered in the partition. Alas, a significant fraction of them stayed back anyway to form an inimical fifth column sympathetic to Pakistan.
  - In the 1946 provincial assembly elections, the Muslim League captured 4.5 million of about 6 million Muslim votes. So, 75% of Indian Muslims voted for the Muslim League and its demand for Pakistan. (One can probably even dig up district-wise statistics. I recall it was 90% of UP, Delhi.) But 75% of Indian muslims in various regions did not go to pAkistan despite voting for it. Though a small "elite" fraction of the adult population were eligible to vote - one can hardly say that this sample was not representative of the rest of the muslim population.

- Sardar Patel (Calcutta maidan 03-Jan-1948) asked how the Muslims remaining in India after partition suddenly claim loyalty to India: [YT1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1URZmiFsUg)


#### Contrast with others
- Contrast with military betrayals by followers of other belief systems:
    - Buddhist betrayal of their nation is rare and is contrary to buddha's teachings.


### Other Government harrassment of infiedels

#### Economic punishment

- About a certain Islamic ruler of India: "Muslims were exempted from paying the housetax and taxes on grain and other goods meant for their personal use. Hindus converting to Islam were exempted from specific taxes. Special attention was given to the education of Muslim children. Towards the end of his reign Muslims made up a very large majority of his senior most nobility."
- "Or consider historian Prof. KS Lal’s works on caste and religion, refuting with primary data the seeming truism, launched by the Communist Party ideologue MN Roy and now omnipresent in the textbooks, that the lowest castes converted en masse to Islam because of its claimed message of equality. Islam mainly won over the urban middle castes (and not because of eguality, a value rejected as ingratitude towards the Dispenser of destinies in the Quran, but because of the privileges vis-à-vis non-Muslims), not the Untouchables. Again, the silent treatment has been the only response the “experts” could muster." \[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]

### Inhibiting religious practice.

- chaitanya-mangala, vijaya gupta's poem on Husain Shah summarized [here](http://i.imgur.com/Nktg3CY.png) ([book](http://www.voiceofdharma.org/books/siii/ch10.htm) \- Caveat: Goel [misattributes vijaya-gupta-quote](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=The+wicked+mlechhas+pollute+the+religion+of+the+Hindus+every+day&cad=h) to gangAdEvI).

### Temple and university destruction.

- This can happen as government policy or as a matter of riots.
- Summary: Muhammad's example as \*the ideal muslim\* has motivated murderers and pillagers throughout the ages, including in my country. Like early christians who burnt down the library of Alexandria, they destroyed the great universities of naLandA and vikramashIlA, the temples they razed are too numerous to count - zarathruShTa's favorite tree, the sphynxes nose, tombs of Timbuktu, buddha-s of bAmiyAn being well known examples in the wider world.

#### Iconoclasm

- Islamic iconoclasm is well known. Some salient examples are given below.
    - Saudi Arabia and the middle east:
        - muhammad and the idols at kAbA.
        - Nose of the sphynx.
        - The tree planted by ZarathruShTa.
        - ISIL kalIf
            - Yazidi temples.
            - Museum vandalism and library burning - [DM201502](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2970270/Islamic-State-fighters-destroy-antiquities-Iraq-video.html). [Nimrud](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/world/middleeast/isis-attacks-iraqi-archaeological-site-at-nimrud.html?smid=fb-share&_r=1). Palmyra.
        - Lybia - [NYT15](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling): Under a line of vandalized bas-reliefs, I saw a spray-painted message in Arabic script: “Destroy the stone idols, no to restoration.”

#### Limited digestion of polytheism and icon worship

Sufi and shia dargah-s provide for some limited outlet for polytheistic and iconophilic tendencies.

#### Destruction of centers of learning.

- Central Asia:
    - "The Moslem scientist Al-Biruni himself informs us that in the major cities of Khwarizm, Qutayba demolished huge libraries and burnt their numerous Indic and Iranic texts. Al-Biruni also mentions that he systematically killed all the Indic and Iranian scholars who manned those libraries." \[[M](http://www.indiafacts.co.in/isis-caliphate-lessons-earliest-mohammedan-invasions-central-asia/)\]
    - "Every historian and archaeologist of that period knows that the vast Buddhist and Jain establishments at Bukhara, Samarkand, Khotan, Balkh, Bamian, Begram, Jalalabad, Peshawar, Takshasila, Mirpur-Khas, Nagar-Parkar, Sringar, Sialkot, Agroha, Mathura, Hastinapur, Kanauj, Sravasti, Ayodhya, Sarnath, Nalanda, Vikramsila, Vaishali, Rajgir, Odantpuri, Bharhut, Paharpur, Jagaddala, Jajnagar, Nagarjunikonda, Amaravati, Kanchi, Dwarasamudra, Bharuch Valabhi, Palitana, Girnar, Patan, Jalor, Chandrawati, Bhinmal, Didwana, Nagaur, Osian, Bairat, Gwalior and Mandu were destroyed by the swordsmen of Islam." \[[SG](http://voiceofdharma.in/hindu-temples-what-happened-to-them-vol-1/some-historical-questions)\]
- In India the great universities at Nalanda and Vikramashila were destroyed; schools in Kashi, Multan and Thatta were suppressed.
- Claim: "Universities were nice things but not essential to Hindu survivial."
    - Hindu-s do and did have centers of learning, where students and teachers congregated. These were critical to the efflorecence of hindu thought.
        - “The padishaw, cherisher of Mohammedanism learned that in the provinces of Thatta, Multan and especially at Benaras, the brAhmaNa infidels used to teach their false books in their established schools, and their admirers and students, both Hindu and Muslim, used to come from great distances to these misguided men in order to acquire their vile learning. His Majesty, eager to establish Islam, issued orders to the governors of all the provinces to demolish the schools and temples of the infidels, and, with the utmost urgency, put down the teaching and the public practice of the religion of these unbelievers (imperial decree of 9th April 1669).” \[Secondary source: [M](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/)\]
        - Even during the British era, it was fairly common for scholars from southern India to soujourn to Kashi to gain advanced knowledge and prove their mettle. Even today in southern weddings, the groom ritually expresses his desire to go to Kashi (the motivation bein both religious and educational) before being ritually enticed into staying home.
            
    - Of course, much knowledge was diffuse and preserved in households. But, much "advanced learning" was lost. The example of several lost hindu traditions based in kAshmIra and in Sindh are prime examples of this.

### Other cultural degradation

#### Cruelty to culturally important animals

- Torturing dogs in zoroastrian areas of Iran \[[arch](https://archive.org/stream/APersianStrongholdOfZoroastrianism/BoyceMaryaPersianStrongholdOfZoroastrianism#page/n79/mode/2up)\]
- Cow killing in India.
  - "‘Ala Hazrat’ the founder of Barelvis, arguably one of the top “reformers” of the Indian Mohammedans of the last century, wrote a Fatwa tract in early 1900s entitled Qurban-ul-Bakr, that made it mandatory for Indian Moslems to slaughter Cow instead of other animals. He said a particular thing becomes mandatory for M in reaction to any initiative that dilutes the full limits of Sharia. Therefore, he argued, since some want M to give up cow slaughter and use other animals since Sharia allows it, while it is normally fine, but because it “limits” the practice to reduced allowance of full Sharia, it becomes mandatory for Muslims to react by slaughtering cows only. Normally it would have been permissible but in reaction, it is mandatory."  {[YT](https://youtu.be/Gxw6okCPURA?t=678)}

#### Language : Sanskrit vs Farsi

- The entry of Persian into India was mostly due to it being the court / official language of a great Muslim kings. It was "high culture" for them (even if they were ethnic turks). This is how India got the camp language (urdu) with its heavy use of farsi and arabic loan words. Common soldiers in the camps had to converse with the farsi spouting nobility.
    - To quote [Sandeep](http://www.sandeepweb.com/2012/11/27/coming-soon-an-entitlement-university-named-after-a-mass-murderer/):
        - "Kannada was the official language of the Mysore state when the Wodeyar dynasty ruled over the Mysore kingdom…When Tipu took over, he changed the administrative language from Kannada to Farsi. We can witness this till date. Karnataka Government’s land and revenue records use Farsi terminology. For instance, a usage like “Ramesh’s son Suresh” is written as “Suresh bin Ramesh.” Our state has retained terms like “Khata,” “Khirdi,” “Pahani,” “Khanesuvari,” “Gudasta,” and “Baranamoona,” a direct holdover from Tipu’s times. Not just that—Tipu changed the names of entire cities and towns: Brahmapuri became Sultanpet, Kallikote became Farookabad, Chitradurga became Farook yab Hissar, Coorg became Zafarabad, Devanahalli became Yusufabad, Dinigul became Khaleelabad, Gutti became Faiz Hissar, Krishnagiri became Phalk-il-azam, Mysore became Nazarabad, Penukonda became Fakrabad, Sankridurga became Muzaffarabad, Sira became Rustumabad, and Sakleshpur became Manjarabad…Muslims in Malabar speak, read and write Malayalam even today just as Tamil Muslims in Tamil Nadu read, write and speak in Tamil. Thanks to Tipu, Muslims in Karnataka speak only Urdu. This is the direct result of Tipu’s insistence that Farsi and Urdu were the only permitted mediums of instruction."
            
- Some Muslim rulers did patronize Sanskrit scholars and poets, if only to record history and songs of praise, communicate with their hindu subjects. These are more the exception than the rule.
    - In the Mughal court:
        - "translations of Sanskrit works patronized by the Mughal court such as the _Razmnamah_ (a translation of the _Mahabharata_) and the _Ramayan_ (a translation of the _Ramayana_)." (From [here](http://dissertationreviews.org/archives/2350)).
        - The great aesthetician Jagannatha Pandita spent time at the mughal court.
            
- Some Muslim rulers, who were apostates showed genuine appreciation for hindu arts and sciences.
    - Jalaludin Akbar after his apostasy, the great Dara Sukoh, Ibrahim Adil Shah.
        
- Falsehood: "Muslim emperors mostly patronized Sanksrit. The entry of Persian into India was mostly due to direct migration of mystics, artisans and scholars from Persia after the Mongol attacks."
    - Manasatarangini on an example of [this canard](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/the-hindu-struggle-in-the-mountains-and-a-discursion-on-philological-encounters-with-the-turushka-s/).
        - " From the record of Ferishta, he appears to have merely had translated one of the 1300 books in the library and plagiarized it as his own work. What happened to the rest of the 1299 books? We hear much later of these books from Abdul Qadir al-Badaoni. Pressurized by the Padishaw Akbar to acquire old Hindu and Hermetic material, he managed to lay his hands on what remained of them in Lahore. He describes the text that was plagiarized as the Dalayil-i-Firoz Shahi... Third, we must note that though the translated material survived in Lahore during Akbar’s days none of these texts, including the one plagiarized by Firuz under his name, have survived to date. Thus, one can confidently state that the Islamic actions did not result in salvaging of the original Sanskrit texts but their complete destruction."
        - "As an example, one might cite the case of loss of the critical tantra-s and vaidika texts from Kashmir due to Sikandar but-shikan – shrIvara describes him as burning all Hindu libraries he could lay hands on (sakala pustakAn niShUdita) – so much for the great Kashmiriyat."
    - There are Tippu Sultan's Shringeri letters - for that matter, there are pictures of Mahmud of Ghazni's Sanskrit coins (If it should be of assistance in fooling oneself and others). Sandeep's [book on Tipu](http://www.amazon.com/Tipu-Sultan-Tyrant-Mysore-History-ebook/dp/B00H2LWIG4).
