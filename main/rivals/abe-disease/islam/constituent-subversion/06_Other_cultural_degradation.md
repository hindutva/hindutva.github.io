## Cruelty to culturally important animals

- Torturing dogs in zoroastrian areas of Iran \[[arch](https://archive.org/stream/APersianStrongholdOfZoroastrianism/BoyceMaryaPersianStrongholdOfZoroastrianism#page/n79/mode/2up)\]
- Cow killing in India.
  - "‘Ala Hazrat’ the founder of Barelvis, arguably one of the top “reformers” of the Indian Mohammedans of the last century, wrote a Fatwa tract in early 1900s entitled Qurban-ul-Bakr, that made it mandatory for Indian Moslems to slaughter Cow instead of other animals. He said a particular thing becomes mandatory for M in reaction to any initiative that dilutes the full limits of Sharia. Therefore, he argued, since some want M to give up cow slaughter and use other animals since Sharia allows it, while it is normally fine, but because it “limits” the practice to reduced allowance of full Sharia, it becomes mandatory for Muslims to react by slaughtering cows only. Normally it would have been permissible but in reaction, it is mandatory."  {[YT](https://youtu.be/Gxw6okCPURA?t=678)}
