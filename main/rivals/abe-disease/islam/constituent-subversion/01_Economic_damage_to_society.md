- Indian economic share went down due to the trauma of Islamic invasion. \[[At16](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/the-economic-history-of-the-last-2-000-years-in-1-little-graph/258676/)\]

## Economic punishment

- About a certain Islamic ruler of India: "Muslims were exempted from paying the housetax and taxes on grain and other goods meant for their personal use. Hindus converting to Islam were exempted from specific taxes. Special attention was given to the education of Muslim children. Towards the end of his reign Muslims made up a very large majority of his senior most nobility."
- "Or consider historian Prof. KS Lal’s works on caste and religion, refuting with primary data the seeming truism, launched by the Communist Party ideologue MN Roy and now omnipresent in the textbooks, that the lowest castes converted en masse to Islam because of its claimed message of equality. Islam mainly won over the urban middle castes (and not because of equality, a value rejected as ingratitude towards the Dispenser of destinies in the Quran, but because of the privileges vis-à-vis non-Muslims), not the Untouchables. Again, the silent treatment has been the only response the “experts” could muster." \[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]

## Parasitic relation to the other

A summary from @parikramah:

- 1\. The jihadi mindset has a split personality of violent dominance or wailing demand w.r.t. Other, & an antipathy to mundane work.
- 2\. Qur'an 8.69 etc make it clear that the normal situation is for the jihadi to live off the kuffar. Many modes are listed.
- 4\. But also in a state of Dar-ul-Harb, via other soft means, making demands for concessions. The Anjem Choudarys live off dole.
- 5\. After British occupation, Indian Muslim Ashraf complained of the "mulazimana zehniyat" (slave mentality) of 9-5 work culture.
- 6\. Loss of sinecures and privy purses, having to compete with kuffar as employees for a living - considered "slavish" by Ashraf.
- 7\. That is "ghanaa" (plenitude) attitude. Next is "faqr" - demands made in "poverty". Both speak from moral high ground.
- 8\. Thus, Sufi "faqeers" ("poor") appeal to  conscience, demanding sustenance - from moral high ground. Like Buddhist bhikshus.
- 9\. Whether in ghanaa or faqr mindset, goal is to live off the Other: "Allah ke naam pe loonga baba" "Allah ke naam pe de de baba"
- 10\. The Other is non-Muslim, or impure Muslims. Many Sufi tariqats considered other Muslims worldly & kuffar. Yet lived off them.

## Tolerance ransom

### Examples
- A'zeb slaughters cow in and occupies a big temple built by a rich jain merchant of gujarat, on complaint by the said merchant, who had influence at the court, the emperor orders him to handover the temple back and pay for all the damages.
- Another case where a rajput under incarceration promises 50,000 payment and other things on release, shahjahan adds condition of conversion. Who opposes it ? Aurangzeb. Why? Because in that case, he won't be able to raise the money (which he was going to do through his Hindu contacts).
