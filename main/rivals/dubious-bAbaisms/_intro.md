title: +Dubious babaisms

## Introduction
Dubious baba-s are either a particular class of [Idiot bAbas](../../polity/external-affairs/id/idiot-bAba/) or enemy subversives (eg: sUfi-s among muslims).

## Summary
Just as it is unwise to habituate oneself to cigarettes or liquor to beat pain or grief, it is unwise carelessly resort to babaistic traditions of dubious provenance.

To recall the words of the lord of vRShNis - 
"यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः।  
 न स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम्।।  
 तस्माच्शास्त्रं प्रमाणं ते कार्याऽकार्यव्यवस्थितौ ।  
 ज्ञात्वा शास्त्रविधानोक्तं कर्म कर्तुमिहार्हसि ॥"

## Immune sytem analogy
Consider the healthy body. It's immune system correctly distinguishes self from enemy cells and quickly dispatches ingressing germs.

Now consider an immuno-compromised body (eg: from infection due to HIV or immuno-suppressent secretions from parasites). It cannot identify enemy cells well enough and soon dies.

For completeness, consider a body with auto-immune disorder (as in arthritis, asthma etc..). Here immune system mistakes friendly cells as enemies and attacks them. This results in ill-health and suffering.

Now extend the analogy to memes. With regards to babaisms, one must ask whether one is unwittingly destroying one's immunity and the ability to distinguish religious friend from foe. People with compromised memetic immunity will end up getting lost - oft within a few generations. 

## Attractions
One may be attracted by miracle stories or experiences (I had this disease/ personal problem, someone said pray to jeebus, and it went away) - but one must note that one can resort to relatively "safe" and oft equally (if not more) powerful alternatives which don't have the same downsides. The same applies to cases where one finds some spiritual high or lovely community.
