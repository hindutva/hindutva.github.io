## Division of power, scale-free feudalism.

Consider the list of individual heroes involved in politics and war. Thence we learn the following. Where ever kShatriyas tasked with protecting their land (as if it were their wife) and subjects (as if they were their children) fell, others rose to take their place (eg: harihara and bukka, chandragupta maurya, shivAji, reDDi chieftains). They were guided and inspired by learned men and sages (eg: tukArAm, vidyAraNya, chANakya). Further, their efforts were financed often by taxation, but also sometimes by donations from merchants. This division of power (in the form of occupation specific jAti-s) lent to the civilization the character of a multi-headed snake - chop one head off, another takes its place.

MT [says](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/): "the sAmanta-maNDala system, far from being a form of feudalism that undid the Indians, provided them with an intrinsic robustness that allowed them to counter the Moslems once the top layers of the scale-free structure had been knocked out." panchAyata of a village -> sAmanta in a nagara -\> mahAsAmanta -> king.

## Resistance to alien invasions and resurgence .

- Constant low level pesant revolt against muslim rulers was noted by Peter Mundy, Manucci, Abul Fazl, Bernier, Jahangir, Kopf. (sItA-rAm-goel's assessment [here](http://www.voiceofdharma.org/books/siii/ch9.htm).
)

### (Dis)Unity

#### Effective disunited resistance

Very strong resistance to foreign invasion has been repeatedly observed. With regard to the Muslim invasions, it must be noted that for over a 1000 years, there was on average 1 battle every month between local resistors and Islamic armies. Even as proud civilizations from Iran to Indonesia fell, the native Hindu culture survived. Earlier invaders, such as the shAkas, huNas, yavanas were similarly checked. Empires such as the paramAras, the vijayanagara empire, the marATha empire repeatedly checked for many centuries, and were beginning to reverse Islamic invasion. Like the European crusades launched to conquer Palestine, similar efforts began to be observed late in the 18th century with the marATha and sikh confrederacies.

The above negates the common accusation of abject failure in the face of invaders.

#### Lack of a united fronts against invaders

Fragmentation of the land of the Arya-s (and more broadly pagans) into several competing polities resulted in these kingdoms short-sightedlyworking against their pagan neighbors by:

- allying with barbarians (eg. Islamic and Christian invaders)
    - " In this sterile statecraft, centred on the politics of the maNDalayoni, one�s neighbour was always an enemy, and the enemy of an enemy always a friend! Hindu princes, therefore, failed to hang together in the face of a common calamity. In the event, they were hanged separately." \[[SRG](http://www.voiceofdharma.org/books/siii/ch9.htm)\]
- taking advantage of a kingdom's conflict with barbarians to attack it. Examples -
    - someshvara and co killing bhojarAja (who had undertook great expeditions against the muslim invasion) in battle.
    - the gajapati ruler relentlessly scheming against his own son-in-law kRShNadevarAya, even as the latter was quarrelling with bahmani sultanates.
- fearing to send troops to aid kingdoms being attacked by barbarians, for the fear that their pagan neighbors will take advantage of the weakness.

#### Powerful empires/ frederations

The severe drawback from not having a united front against invaders was keenly felt by luminaries who faced the mlecCha-s such as chANakya (who did not see much promise in the gaNa city-states), mAdhava vidyAraNya, rAmadAsa (perhaps just as even kRShNa considered his yAdava-gaNa). So, at times of need, powerful empires did form and they proved to have a greater impact in resisting invaders (eg. mAurya-s under chandragupta, gupta-s under vikramAditya, marATha-s, to some extant sikha-s). Yet, to the extant these frederations had \*hindu\* competitors, they paid the usual fragmentation penalty.

### Taking the battle into alien lands

"The second need of the situation was a forward policy which would have taken the war into the heartland of Islam, instead of being fought over the length and breadth of Bharatavarsha. But the Hindus during this period were afflicted by a fortress psychology. They waited for the invader till he arrived at Panipat, or shut themselves into citadels which could be stormed or starved into surrender while the unprotected populace outside was slaughtered. Nor did they ever pursue and destroy the invader even when he was defeated and made of flee. If the Chaulukyas of Gujarat had pursued and destroyed Muhammad Ghuri and his hordes when he was defeated by them in his first expedition in 1178 AD, he would not have come back to Tarain in 1191 AD. Again, if the Chauhans had pursued and punished Ghuri after his defeat in the first battle of Tarain, there would have been no second battle of Tarain, and perhaps no more Muslim invasion of India, at least for some time to come. The effectiveness of a forward policy was demonstrated first by the Marathas under Shivaji, and later on by the Sikhs under Banda Bahadur. But that was against an Islamic state already established in India." \[[SRG](http://www.voiceofdharma.org/books/siii/ch9.htm)\]

  

#### Falling for temple blackmail

al-masUdI: “When the unbelievers march against mUltAn, and the faithful do not feel themselves strong enough to oppose them, they threaten to break their idol, and their enemies immediately withdraw”. Another writer (this one from persia), al-ishtakhri also mentions the same state of affairs regarding the defense of the city against hindu invaders. The self proclaimed butshikan-s were forced to take refuge behind the famous ‘but’ of their capital to retain their kingdom.

  

Counterexamples

- shivAji's resisting attempts by afzal khan and shaiste khan to rouse him to rashness by temple destruction.

## Adaption of military technology and tactics

Horse problem - Ancient and mideval sources (shAlihotra, sAyaNa) acknowledged the importance of horses in military success. \[[Tw](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/679471919507320835)\]

  

Muskets and the firing line were adapted early. \[Inquiring [post](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/06/28/handguns-in-hindu-military-why-the-slow-adoption/).\]

Adaption of European advances in tactics and weaponry was only partial - [Gordon 98 pdf](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/67903/10.1177_001946469803500301.pdf?sequence=2).

  

## Misplaced mercy and lack of ruthlessness

One drawback we hindus had was misplaced generosity - a paucity of ruthlessness. The source is nothing but moral weakness and fragility. These people want approval and admiration of others. This is the disease that motivated moronic actions right from dharmarAja to PrithvirAja Chauhan to Nehru and Gandhi.

- Think what kind of disaster it would have been if kRShNa thought that way. That yudhiShThira gave duryodhana his choice of weapon and combatant when he emerged from the lake hiding spot, and kRShNa scolded him - "Again, even now you are gambling! A deceitful person should be destroyed with deceit without this kind of show." Alas! this consciousness found in bhIma and kRShNa turned out to be so rare!

### Not expelling Islam

Unlike spanish reconquista or the jApanese expulsion of christianity, various hindu empires did not mostly expel Islam from their conquered lands. This was a huge cumulative mistake.

## Failures.

Why did we loose to the British in the end, just as we were beating back Islam? MT's analysis [here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/).

Not learning from history, misplaced mercy (The likes of Malik Kafur, Md Ghori being released after defeat). Insufficient ruthlessness in facing the Islamic threat (not taking adequate steps at suppressing Islamic ideology, once the enemy states were defeated).  

- Bharatendu's [account](http://bharatendu.com/2009/10/13/mana-simha-the-rashtrakuta-ii/) of the differing conditions of the Hindu kings vs the East India Company. 

Traitors aplenty.

  

## Myths

In recent times, many have succumbed to the British manipulative theories such as (MT's analysis [here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/)):

- generally effeminate nature of Hindus (relative to vigorous Muhammadan-s and Europeans)
- superiority of European military discipline
    - Firing by rank
        - MT: "This culture of using the long-bow had already inculcated in the Hindus the precursor to the principle of fire by ranks – indeed Indian texts have long described the constant showers of arrows maintained by different kinds of archers in large scale combats. ... From the marAtha sources and reconstructing the events from the account of the French spy Francois Martin we see that a preliminary form of firing by rank was probably used by the marATha-s during shivAjI’s massive attack on Gingee. The Frenchman’s account indicates that the marATha-s maintained a continuous small arms fire along with heavy artillery fire which was heard as far as Pondicherry. ... The marATha-s used this effectively against the British in the battle of Aligarh, where they killed several English officers by shooting them from behind the treeline with some of the best long barreled flintlocks of the age."
    - Column formation:
        - MT: "Indeed, the example cited by Cooper is that of bAjirao-I deploying the column against tryaMbakrao dAbhADe – as a result tryaMbak was shot and killed as he did not expect a heavy thrust right into his ranks ... The Indo-Aryan military manuals mention the sUchImukha turning into a sarvatobhadra-vyUha when under attack by the ratha-s and ashva-s"
    -   
        
- (dehumanized) martial races
- lacking a culture of military entrepreneurship – i.e., utilizing military manpower as an asset that was available as a commodity that could be leveraged for business.
- inability of the Hindu to mobilize across varNa or jAti lines.
    - Patently false given the examples of shivAjI, mahArANA-pratApa-siMha, durgAvatI, Andhra chiefs (prolaya Vema reddi).
- they had no uniforms
    - MT notes: "The evidence from the dattAjI mAlkare bakhar shows that shivAjI was already issuing standardized turbans and clothing to his enlisted troops and this seems to have continued at least till bAjIrao. One can ultimately trace the presence of military uniform in the subcontinent back to the arthashAstra from the mauryan period."

### Arab intrusion into sindh

It started with a naval raid sent by kaliif umar companion of muhammad, which was destroyed by chAlukya-s near thAne \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/a-record-of-the-early-arab-invasions-before-the-ravaging-of-sindhu/)\].

"It was only after 13 successive attempts that the Moslems finally breached and destroyed the Hindu kingdom of sindhu. .. But one major unanswered question of history arises: what was the cause of failure of the saindhava kingdom against ibn Qasim when it had until then pretty effectively resisted the Moslems for a period of nearly 75 years." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/a-record-of-the-early-arab-invasions-before-the-ravaging-of-sindhu/)\]

### Maratha/ Hindu loss to the British

    - [WP](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/08/15/reasons-for-maratha-hindu-loss-to-the-british-v0/).

#### Reasons

- British grand strategy and understanding of the enemy was much superior to ours.
    - "The British had been planning on how to colonize India as far back as early 1700's while the Marathas were in their life and death struggle with the Mughals."
    - "Besides, the British Plan already had the solid backing of a very thorough study of India by now and evaluation of its people. Consider this: Captain James Tod had already surveyed the history and geography of the entire rAjapUta country with every single one of its clan – even though they were politically still independent – and had already produced in the first two decade his celebrated ‘Annals and Antiquities of rAjapUtAnA’, not to mention that the European Indology as a discipline was already flourishing with its second generation with the likes of Colebrooke and Schlegel now in chairs, William Jones dead just a couple of years back. In contrast, we seriously doubt if there was even one Hindu at the time who properly knew the basic history and geography of Britain!"  \[[BE](http://bharatendu.com/2009/10/13/mana-simha-the-rashtrakuta-ii/)\]
    - Our understanding of the enemy was inferior.
- Perimeter strategy, fed by sea lanes they dominated.
    - "The above point leads naturally to the most important issue – by controlling the trade routes by sea the English could develop a perimeter strategy in which they could hem the Hindus on all sides using their control of key coastal centers – Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. Thus, the marATha-s came to be naturally surrounded by the English, who could indefinitely keep themselves supplied by sea, even as they cut off the Hindu communication lines inside the country. They completed the perimeter strategy by the third Anglo-Maratha war and this more or less doomed the first war of independence in 1857."[MT11](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/)
- Reliance on treacherous mlecCha merceneries on our side
    - Betrayal by European officers hired by Marathas into their army. [W16](http://thewire.in/67934/assaye-when-british-blades-triumphed-over-maratha-guns/)
        - "The truth is the Indians were not ethnocentric enough, whereas the Europeans were just beginning to evolve a sense of white identity. " ... "It needs to be emphasized again that the Hindu shortfall in this regard was not due to the lack of Hindu identity as the leukosphere would like to claim, but simply due to the Hindu failure to properly read the developing identity of the “other” in their payroll." [MT11](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/)
- Better revenue collection and army payment system by the British  [W16](http://thewire.in/67934/assaye-when-british-blades-triumphed-over-maratha-guns/).
    - Use of reliable Indian merceneries and forces by the British, using their colonial money.
        - "Indeed, a key ability of the English was to purchase loyalties for money."
        - Indians had kept up the ancient Indo Eurpean mercenary tradition to the advantage of the enemies.
- Maratha losses contrasted with battle hardened British leadership.
    - Death of experienced Maratha leaders at Panipat
    - "Such men leading their companies as Maj. General Charles Cornwallis, who had resisted George Washington in battles of New York, Princeton, Philadelphia and Virginia, before now coming to India to redeem his repute; Arthur Wellesley, whose war-resume boasted of extremely diverse experience across the continents ranging from the Flanders Wars along side the Austrians against the French, the naval war against Spanish in Philippines, action in Iberian peninsula, and finally the Waterloo campaign that ended the career of Napoleon, besides being a superb politician – he retired as the PM of UK; Thomas Hislop who had seen action on the British side during the American as well as French Revolutionary Wars, had commanded naval operations against Dutch in West Indies, had successfully led the Siege of Gibraltar defeating joint armies of Spaniards and French, now leading British action against the maharaTTA-s; General Gerard Lake, veteran of American, French and Irish wars; General David Ochterlony, an American colonial product born in Boston and veteran of a variety of battles in America and Europe before arriving in India (famous for his harem in dillI of over a dozen women)." \[[BE](http://bharatendu.com/2009/10/13/mana-simha-the-rashtrakuta-ii/)\]
    - marATha sikh relations: only occasional cooperation \[[SE](http://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/the-sikh-empire-1799-1839/maratha-sikh-relations)\].
- Maratha disunity and infighting.
    - yashvanta-rAv holkar tried but failed to marshall all chiefs. \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/vvkbkvv/status/761695493940535296), [MT04](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/05/13/end-of-the-maharattas-i/)\]
- There was more incentive for the British limited-term appointed leadership to gain glory during their term in office. ()
    - Turns out this is an ancient ancient trick. It was observed in the first punic war, where the annually appointed Roman consuls had great incentive to  make bold moves and grab glory before their appointment was up. See [YT_P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bny4hcoUq4&feature=youtu.be&list=PLkOo_Hy3liEJYEQ23l6bDrFrQYdkoZ3BC&t=1851).

#### Non reasons

- Technological differences were not a major factor, neither was military technique.
    - "The technological difference explanation doesn't wash as far as land armies go, in fact I would say the gap is greater today than it was back then. Yes navally we were surpassed but on land the Marathas could hold their own." [SP_FB](https://www.facebook.com/vishvas.vasuki/posts/10153070311757989:0)
