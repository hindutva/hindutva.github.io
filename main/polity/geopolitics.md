### India vs the mlechCha-s: A conflict vs erasure/ penury

"The lessons learned by other nations show what lies ahead. You have the rudhira-varṇa-s of mahākrauñcadvīpa whose numerous tribes were overpowered and exterminated by the mleccha-s. Then there are the kṛṣṇa-s of sthūladvīpa whom they along with the marūnmatta-s reduced to being slaves. They have been excluded from civilization and left with merely the preta/rākṣasa-pustaka in their hand. Among the pītavarṇa-s, the cīna-s and the ati-prācya-s fought the mleccha-s but were defeated. Yet, by paying an enormous price they either expanded their territorial integrity (the cīna-s) or at least kept the śava-mata limited in their lands (the bindudhvaja-s). These illustrate to you the options that are available for bhārata-s – either you make an exit without even realizing you are out, or you prepare for a conflict where your costs will be enormous. Else a puerile existence will indeed be the nation’s lot like that of the cīna-bhṛtya-s at the edge of the mahādvīpa. Of the dasyu-s, the mleccha-s do not even need to attack directly anymore – by using the marūnmatta-s and their plants, the śavārādhaka-s, they can sink the Hindus if they continue the way they are. The cīna-s will joyfully grab up the rest even as the Hindus are claiming that they had civilizationally subjugated them from the time of Taizong."" \[[MT14](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/09/14/the-fifth-story/)\]

### Economic rich vs the poor

- Rich countries use unfair trade practices etc.. to suck much more money out of poorer countries than they provide in "aid" - [TheRulesVid1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWSxzjyMNpU). [Fact-sheet](http://therules.org/inequality-video-fact-sheet/) excerpts here:
    
    - Richest 200 people have about [$2.7 trillion](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/the-world-s-200-richest-people.html), which is more than the poorest 3.5 billion people, who have only [$2.2 trillion](http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2006/dec/06/business.internationalnews_) combined.
    - Poor countries: rich countries wealth ratio has been increasing and now stands at about 1:80. From the United Nations Development Program’s 1999 [Human Development Report](http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr1999/).
    - The amount of aid that rich countries give to developing countries each year, about $130 billion, comes from the OECD Aid Statistics report.
    - The claim that corporations steal more than $900 billion from developing countries each year through tax avoidance comes from a 2012 report from [Global Financial Integrity](http://iff.gfintegrity.org/iff2012/2012report.html).
    - The claim that developing countries pay $600 billion each year in debt service comes from the World Bank’s [International Debt Statistics](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/international-debt-statistics) databank.
    - The claim that developing countries lose about $500 billion each year as a consequence of trade rules imposed by rich countries (through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) comes from Robert Pollin’s 2003 book [Contours of Descent](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ro8ebd53RX4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contours+of+Descent&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qiZvUbfRL6ml0wX-1IHIAg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).
    - If we could quantify the value of that land we could have added a huge amount to the $2 trillion stack of cash that the video depicts flowing from poor to rich.
    
      
    

### China

- Territorial aggression by mainland China is being opposed by a good coalition of neighbors - India, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Korea, Mongolia, Russia.
- More background [here](../../../paganology/china/).

### USA \[2013\]

- Layers
    - Soft pop culture exterior.
    - Powerful, efficient institutions.
        - Government
        - Business
        - Church  
            
    - White Judeo-christian + patriotic "manifest destiny" core.
        - Common goal: Preservation of economic power, lifestyle.  
            
        - Branches  
            
            - Liberalism
            
            - Push the false claim: Western ethics = human rights.  
                
            - They try to hide their White Judeo-christian beliefs and perspective, but it is there.  
            - Conservativism
                - Bible centered thought.
                - Safety net during adversity.

- Regarding India  
    - Hindu thought has penetrated US pop culture (though not the core). So, India is worthy of being a "cool" satellite to the US core. \[See [American Veda](http://americanveda.com/), for details.\]
    - USA wants subservient powers in the region to offset China. It is averse to India or Japan growing into assertive and powerful "equal" partners.
    - Evangelical Abrahamist lobby is powerful. NGO's receiving funds from USAID and American public are active in suberting hindu culture and power. Example:
        - They [were active](http://plus.url.google.com/url?sa=z&n=1388342848381&url=http%3A%2F%2Findia.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F12%2F05%2Fu-s-evangelicals-indian-expats-teamed-up-to-push-through-modi-visa-ban%2F%3Femc%3Dedit_tnt_20131205%26tntemail0%3Dy%26_r%3D1%26&usg=UL19d9G051BEu0wXCAZdk2_6fzs.) in denying narendra moDi a visa.
        - This influence has been explored in detail in ["Breaking India: Western Interventions in Dravidian and Dalit Faultlines".](http://www.breakingindia.com/)
- Threat narrative
    - Growing economic and military might of China.
    - Islam.
        - This is a relatively new (post 9/11) item.

### Terrorist state of Pakistan \[2012\]  

Pakistan's problem with India (especially kashmir) is not one arising over the need for greater security (or neutralizing a threat) - but is ideological (Christine Fair [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3DIOjTmX0M#t=631) says: "a greedy state"). US strategy has been to attempt to put Pakistan at ease (via-a-vis India) by providing it with more weapons and aids - this has failed.

Pakistan's "civil" society has roughly the same ideological preferences as the military. Its youth continue to be conservative. Even if the truly liberal come to power, the army will undercut anything that opposes its goals (viz economic / social friendship with India) - as had happened in the 1997 Kargil conflict. One hope is that as the demographics of the officer core of the Pakistan army changes to include non-panjAbi-s, the ideological bent of Pakistani army will change.

#### Support for an out-of-control jihAd  

Pakistan has a long history of using jihAdi terrorism as an instrument of foreign policy - mostly to reestablish (their own) Islamic rule in Kashmir. It assisted USA in its war against Soviet Union in Afghanistan (though it had started this "jihad" several years prior to that). Later, the jihAd (irregular assymetric conflict with India) came under the Pakistani nuclear umbrella. The mujAhidIn it reared for these conflicts are no longer under the control of the pAkistAni state - some of them are waging war against pAkistAn.  

Arms of the Pakistani state - particularly the Inter Services Intelligence agency (ISI) and parts of its army suppord jihAdi-s. Eg: Osama bin laden was killed close to a major army base in Pakistan; mumbai terrorist attacks ([1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqaSDgFpP1M), [2](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/david-headley/)) were coordinated by ISI. There is also wide support for jihAd from large sections of the pAkistAni population who, given the dysfunctional state, are educated in madarasa-s which preach jihAd against kaffir-s. It is in fact where dovout muslims from around the world, wanting to fight and die, go for training.

#### Mistreatment of hindu minority.

In the same theme, the hindu+sikh minority is mistreated. Rich hindu-s are great targets for kidnapping. Numerous women have been kidnapped, converted to Islam and forced into marriage ([1](http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article3750443.ece)).

Even quasi-islamic sects like Ahmadiya-s and shia-s are frequent targets of terrorist attacks.  

#### Future

Not sure.
