## Hindu ethos
- Examples
  - Israel example [here](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.628365). 
  - Burma's "protection of race and religion" laws here.
- Stop favoring non-hindu/ anti-hindu religions, and unnecessarily controlling hindu affairs.  
- Temple control out of sickular government hands.
    - Karnataka has spent a mere 1/5 of the money it earned due to its management of hindu temples/ institutions for upkeep/ donation. The rest was assigned to Muslim and Christian institutions ([ES](http://www.esamskriti.com/essay-chapters/Why-must-temple-collections-be-controlled-by-the-Indian-Government-1.aspx)).
- Various cases of double standards by Indian courts should be curbed.
    - jalli kaTTu, dahi haNDi limitations vs ashura ([TW16](https://twitter.com/SirZaidHamid/status/786456228989919233)).
- This 2012 rioting bill with special treatment against the "majority" should be trashed.
- The Indian government, at long last, was ordered to stop providing [haj subsidies](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Muslim-leaders-welcome-Supreme-Courts-decision-to-abolish-Haj-subsidy/articleshow/13052845.cms/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=toionFB) to muslim pilgrims.
- Stop giving easy loans to people just because they are not Hindu-s.
- Hindu soldiers must be allowed to wear religious symbols. \[[N](http://wwrn.org/articles/13806/?&place=india&section=church-state)\]      
- Language
    - Transition towards use of Prakrits (at state level) and Sanskrit at national level for adminitration and governance (Carl's [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/sankrant1/language-policy-for-a-new-india-v1)).  
    - Imposition of local language on migrants and consequential regionalism are a huge drain on our human resources \[[MT16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/748000183108177921)\].

## Containing abe's diseases
More specific steps are outlined below.

- The major defiled/ destroyed hindu temples may be legally and efficiently restored from the clutches of Islam.
    - somanAtha-shivAlaya (restored by the great sardAr vallabh bhAi paTel after 1947) and rAma-janma-bhUmI in ayodhyA (Dec 1991) are good starts.
- No Islamic preacher who endorses destruction of temples should be allowed into India.
    - 25k wahabi preachers from Arabia visited India between 2011 and 2014. \[[OI](http://www.oneindia.com/india/ib-vs-wahabi-the-war-against-saudi-funding-1791334.html)\]
- Ban and punish proselytization by Abrahamic religions.
- Muslim migrants to India must be granted citizenship - only if they convert to hindu-s.
    - Immigrants to Germany did this to claim chances of persecution if they return home \[[DA15](http://www.dawn.com/news/1204912/)\].
