## Short term desiderata
Article 370 should stay repealed, that kAshmIri paNDits and any hindu-s willing to live there be resettled in kAshmIr with dignity.

These Urdu Pakistani TV interviews with Pakistani journalist Najam Sethi summarizes my understanding of the situation (both the past and the present): [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwDFdevnyE) and [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye3NC0w4agQ). kAshmIri muslims seem to want freedom from India, while not joining Pakistan either.

## About the kAshmIri paNDit-s

It pains me that the descendents of abhinavagupta, kalhaNa, bilhaNa, kShemendra, kShemarAja, kayyaTa, bhallaTa, rudraTa etc.. should become such dunces that they are dominated by the likes of motilAl and "paNDit" javAharlAl, and that they should then loose their valley in such sorry fashion.

kashmIri paNDit-s were quite scholarly at the turn of the 20th century (Aurel Stein's collaborators [here](http://www.siraurelstein.org.uk/native.html)). Later, however, traitors and idiots reared their heads with motilaal and javAharlaal. This continues today.  

Of course, being an Hindu, I do not want to let the land of abhinavagupta and kashyapa to relapse into Islamic rule. The ethnic cleansing of the hindu Kashmiri paNDit community is a sad event, it was preceded by a proliferation of madarasa-s.
