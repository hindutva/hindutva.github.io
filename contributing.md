## Technical intro
- This site is produced using the Hugo static website generator.
- We use the [sanskrit-documentation-theme-hugo](https://sanskrit-coders.github.io/sanskrit-documentation-theme-hugo/) theme.
- We use disqus for comments.
- We use google analytics for getting stats.

## Guidelines
- Navigation bars configuration: In data/* and sidebars/*.yml.
- Pages are located under content/
  - Regarding the per-page YAML front-matter :
      - Though the pages are hierarchically arranged in subfolders, the final pages are flatly placed - so make sure your permalinks don't contain '/'.
- Local tests:
  - Run `hugo server -p 4000 -v`
  - Look at https://localhost:4000/
